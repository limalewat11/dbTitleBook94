Fixed Point has captured the attention of BBC, NPR, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, Fox News Network, <em>The Christian Post</em>, and many others. Taunton has personally engaged some of the most vociferous opponents of Christianity, including Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, and Peter Singer. He lives in Birmingham, AL.</p>&#x201c;Lively and loving, Taunton&#x2019;s memoir of his surprising friendship could hardly be more enjoyably engrossing.&#x201d; &#x2013; Booklist<br><br>&#x201c;With its unique combination of superb storytelling, intellect, and passion,&nbsp;The Faith of Christopher Hitchens&nbsp;achieves&#x2014;and deserves&#x2014;the rare status of instant classic.&#x201d; &#x2013; Brian Mattson for The Gospel Coalition<br><br>&#x201c;Taunton&#x2019;s smooth and accessible prose brings to life what seems to have been a dear and lively friendship between two thinkers at odds politically and religiously, but not intellectually.&#x201d; &#x2013; Publisher&#x2019;s Weekly<br><br>&#x201c;Larry Taunton&#x2019;s book, The Faith of Christopher Hitchens is so good that words fail me. It is that triple rarity, an astonishing tour-de-force of heart and mind both, and a bona fide page-turner. If it doesn&#x2019;t keep you up late, you are already sleeping. Who dreamt anyone would ever get to see this side of the cartoon enfante terrible? Taunton&#x2019;s unprecedented access to the &#x2018;real&#x2019; Hitchens is a gift from the heavens &#x2014; literally and literarily &#x2014; to anyone wanting to know who he really was, that man behind the withering, glowering mien and fulminating blunderbuss voice. This indefatigably clear-eyed window into the soul of the great Hitch may break your heart with love for its subject, as it did mine, or it may make you wish to rent yourself in twain with rage, Rumpelstilskin-style. Either way, it&#x2019;s quite a book. A triumph.&#x201d; &#x2013; Eric Metaxas, New York Times bestselling author and nationally syndicated radio host<br><br>&#x201c;Beautifully written. You&#x2019;ve got to read this book. Everyone should read this book. You&#x2019;ll really get something out of it.&#x201d; &#x2013; Chris Matthews of MSNBC&#x2019;s Hardball<br><br>&#x201c;Every fan of Christopher Hitchens must read this elegant, honest, and beautiful tale of an improbable friendship between an American Christian and an English atheist. If you thought you knew &#x2018;Hitch,&#x2019; you did not. Now, you will.&#x201d; &#x2013; Paul Reid, bestselling author of The Last Lion, Winston Spencer Churchill: Defender of the Realm<br><br>&#x201c;If you really want to get to know someone intimately, go on a multi-day cross-country road trip, share fine food and expensive spirits, and have open and honest conversations about the most important issues in life. And then engage them in public debate before thousands of people on those very topics. In this engrossing narrative about his friendship with the atheist activist Christopher Hitchens, the evangelical Christian Larry Taunton shows us a side of the man very few of us knew. Apparent contradictions dissolve before Taunton&#x2019;s penetrating insight into the psychology of man fiercely loyal to his friends and passionately devoted to leading a life of integrity. This book should be read by every atheist and theist passionate about the truth, and by anyone who really wants to understand Hitch, one of the greatest minds and literary geniuses of our time.&#x201d; &#x2013; Michael Shermer, Publisher of Skeptic magazine and author of The Moral Arc</p><h2>Initial D, Book 1</h2><p>Follows the adventures of Todo, a racing team with a car called Project D.</p><p></p><h2>Dark Dance</h2><p>Drawn to the ominous house of Scarabae by the promise of passion, Rachaela soon finds herself a prisoner of her own desire, seduced into a dark and dangerous existence by a lover who bears her family name. Original.</p><p>Rachaela Day is an emotionally distant bookshop clerk in present-day London. Abandoned before birth by her enigmatic father, Rachaela has lived alone since the death of her mother. She accepts a mysterious invitation to stay at the seaside house of Scarabae with her estranged father and his family. The Scarabae, whose existence Rachaela's mother fearfully concealed, eventually reveal themselves to be a clan of vampires who must interbreed to keep their bloodlines intact. Mesmerized by her father's spell and seduced, Rachaela flees, only to find that she is pregnant with the heir to the family's legacy. Twelve years later, Rachaela must return to the Scarabae to rescue her daughter, Ruth, who has been taken back in order to fulfill her horrible destiny. Lee ( Sabella ) writes horror stylishly, with passages that often approach the lyrical. Unfortunately, certain elements in this work are overwhelmed by her verbose descriptions, most notably those of the places where the story is set. Additionally, the narrative, which moves at a steady, albeit lingering pace, contains many characters and events that strongly recall similar vampire works . <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Adventures of Augie March (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)</h2><p>Augie&#39;s nonconformity leads him into an eventful, humorous, and sometimes earthy way of life</p><p>"<i>The Adventures of Augie March</i> is the great American novel. Search no further." --Martin Amis, <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i><p> Originally published in 1953, Saul Bellow's modern picaresque tale grandly illustrates twentieth-century man's restless pursuit of an elusive meaning. Augie March, a young man growing up in Chicago during the Great Depression, doesn't understand success on other people's terms. Fleeing to Mexico in search of something to fill his restless soul and soothe his hunger for adventure, Augie latches on to a wild succession of occupations until his journey brings him full circle. Yet beneath Augie's carefree nature lies a reflective person with a strong sense of responsibility to both himself and others, who in the end achieves a success of his own making. A modern-day Columbus, Augie March is a man searching not for land but for self and soul and, ultimately, for his place in the world.</p><p> "A book of extraordinary and massive power ... plainly one of the richest of twentieth-century American novels." --Alfred Kazin</p><p> "[Bellow's] body of work is more capacious of imagination and language than anyone else's.... If there's a candidate for the great American novel, I think this is it." --Salman Rushdie, <i>The Sunday Times</i> (London)</p><p> "The best postwar American novel, <i>The Adventures of Augie March</i> magnificently terminates and fulfills the line of Melville, Twain, and Whitman." --James Wood, <i>The New Republic</i></p><b>SAUL BELLOW</b> (1915-2005) is the only novelist to receive three National Book Awards, for&nbsp;<i>The Adventures of Augie March</i>,&nbsp;<i>Herzog</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Sammler's Planet</i>. He was also awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his novel&nbsp;<i>Humboldt's Gift</i>&nbsp;in 1975, and in 1976 received the Nobel Prize for Literature "for the human understanding and subtle analysis of contemporary culture that are combined in his work."</p><h2>Desserts: Our favorite recipes for every season and every occasion : the best of Martha Stewart living</h2><p>From wonderful classic cakes to inspiring confections of seasonal fruit, these homemade desserts make the most delicious impressions at every occasion--a birthday or wedding, an elegant holiday dinner or casual summer luncheon, a country picnic or everyday meal.

It was called "The Fat Cat," and it read: "Once there was a fat cat. boy was she fat. Well, not that fat. But pretty fat." Even then, I needed an editor.<p>From that point on, I was always writing or composing something. And almost from the very beginning, I was fascinated by the grotesque and macabre. One of my first musical compositions was called "Guillotines in the Springtime." At school, when we were assigned to write a story about a holiday, I always cane up with something like "The Haunted Easter Egg."</p><p>In high school I continued writing poems and stories and composing music. When the school orchestra played one of my compositions at an assembly, everybody thought I was a genius. I did nothing to correct this impression. I went to Harvard, where I was miserable -- and wrote intensely tragic novellas, as well as music for student films and plays.. I also kept a voluminous journal, hundreds of single-spaced typed pages.. I gave them different volume titles like <i>Rats Live on No Evil Star</i>. (That's a palindrome.) I told that journal everything, and most of it is drivel. But it was a lot cheaper than going to a psychotherapist, and maybe I'll get some usable material out of it someday.</p><p>After college I spent a year in England, where I studied musical composition and worked as a pianist at the Royal Ballet School. It was there that I had the experiences which later became my first YA novel, <b>Blackbriar</b>. I really did live in the middle of a forest in an ancient cottage that once had been a pest house for people with small pocks. Because I was still keeping journal, I put all the details down on paper. Back in the States, I turned the journal into a book, and I was lucky -- because the manuscript was rejected by only one publisher. The second editor who saw it, Ann Durell at Dutton, liked it enough to work with me on it through a couple of drafts, until finally she felt it was good enough for publication and offered me a contract.</p><p>My second novel, <b>Run</b>, also took place in a house I had lived in. After that, I ran out of interesting real places to write about. I saw if I was going to make my living as a writer, I was going to have to begin making things up, using my imagination. The result was my first science fiction book, <b>House of Stairs</b>. Although I invented the plot and the setting, the characters in that book were all based on people I knew. I continue to use real people in my books, and that has gotten me into trouble at times. Fortunately, most of my friends have started speaking to me again.</p><p>Gradually, without much planning on it, I began drifting more and more into science fiction, a genre I had always loved. A lot of the fun of writing science fiction is learning about real scientific phenomena, like behavior modifications or black holes or the fourth dimension, and turning them into stories. The challenge is to try to make the parts you invent as believable as the scientific laws you are using. If you succeed, then you are giving the reader something that is magical and fantastic but at the same time might actually be possible.. That's the great thing about science fiction -- someday it could really happen.</p><p>For nine years, I also worked as a rehearsal pianist for the Boston Ballet, touring with them all over Europe and the United States, and composing three ballets that the company performed. (One of them was called <i>Incident at Blackbriar</i>, a nice plug for my book.) Eventually I quit because it was taking too much time away from my writing, and partly because the stressful atmosphere of a ballet company began to get to me. One of the best things about being a writer is that it's a job without a lot of stress. But I did keep notes of everything that happened: the time Giselle's house tipped over and knocked a dancer out cold, the time a dancer fell into the orchestra pit, what it was like to perform in ancient Roman amphitheaters in the rain, the kinds of things dancers say to each other onstage. I continue trying to turn it all into a book, and someday I may do it.</p><p>Now I live part of the year in Bangkok, Thailand, and part of the year in Boston. I write full- time and do a lot of serious cooking. I consider myself extremely fortunate to be able to make a living as a writer. I shouldn't ever run out of ideas -- knock on wood -- since the universe is full of great things like strange attractors and the Mandelbrot set. I still can't get over the fact that time slows down in the presence of a gravitational field. It really does, you know. That's not science fiction. It's a fact."</p><p>copyright ? 2000 by Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.

Friedman asks, &#x201c;to care so much about economic growth as we clearly do?&#x201d; To answer, Friedman reaches beyond economics. He examines the political and social histories of the large Western democracies&#x2014;particularly of the United States since the Civil War&#x2014;distinguishing times of generally rising living standards from those of pervasive stagnation to illustrate how rising incomes render a society more open and democratic. He shows, too, how our attitudes toward economic growth and its consequences have roots in the thinking of prior centuries, especially the Enlightenment, and also include significant strands of religious influence.<br><br>Friedman also delineates the role of economic growth in determining which developing nations extend the broadest freedoms to their citizenry. He makes clear that growth, rather than just the level of living standards, is key to effecting political and social liberalization in the third world. But he also warns that the democratic values of countries even as wealthy as our own are at risk whenever incomes stagnate for extended periods. Merely being rich is no protection against a society&#x2019;s retreat into rigidity and intolerance once enough of its citizens lose the sense that they are getting ahead.<br><br>Finally, Friedman shows us why, if America is to strengthen democratic institutions around the world as a bulwark against terrorism and social unrest, we must aggressively pursue growth at home and promote worldwide economic expansion beyond what purely market-driven forces would create. And for the United States, he offers concrete suggestions for policy steps to achieve those objectives.<br><br>A major contribution to the ongoing debate on the effects of economic growth and globalization.</p><p>Ever feel like you just can't get ahead with the bills? You're not alone. More than half of Americans believe the American dream has become impossible for most people to achieve. And two-thirds think this goal will be even harder for the next generation. (One reason for the gloominess--average full-time income has fallen 15 percent since 1975.) All this has Benjamin Friedman worried. In his hefty, 549-page tome, <i>The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth</i>, the acclaimed Harvard economist and advisor to the Federal Reserve Board says economic stagnation is bad for the moral health of a nation. Friedman, a former chair of Harvard's economics department, argues that economic growth is vital to social and political progress. Witness Hitler's Germany. Without growth, people look for answers in intolerance and fear. And that, Friedman warns, is where the U.S. is headed if the economic stagnation of the past three decades doesn't soon reverse. It's not enough for gross domestic product to rise, he says. Growth also has to be more evenly distributed. The rich shouldn't be the only ones getting richer. <p> Friedman's arguments are provocative but at times lack rigor. In his comparisons of various countries, he offers no objective data to measure their levels of social progress, relying instead on his own--sometimes selective--interpretation of historical events. He glosses over the fact that China, where the economy has grown sevenfold since 1978, has seen little political change in that time. He also acknowledges that the Great Depression--which brought Americans together to achieve great social and political progress--tends to disprove his theory. Friedman makes a good case that the economy sometimes influences social movements, but the jury is still out on exactly when and how that happens. <i>--Alex Roslin</i></p>Benjamin M. Friedman is the William Joseph Maier Professor of Political Economy and former chairman of the Department of Economics at Harvard University, where he has taught for more than three decades. His book <i>Day of Reckoning: The Consequences of American Economic Policy Under Reagan and After</i> received the George S. Eccles Prize, awarded annually for excellence in writing about economics. He has written for <i>The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal,</i> and <i>The New York Review of Books.</i> Most recently he was the 2005 recipient of the John R. Commons Award, presented in recognition of achievements in economics and service to the economics profession.

Due to the incompetence of Queen Elizabeth's current government, the alliance between the Star Kingdom of Manticore and Erewhon is on the verge of dissolution, so the queen sends her niece, Ruth, as a representative to a state funeral to patch things up.

At the same time, Cachat liberates an interstellar slave ship and, in a Machiavellian scheme, puts together an alliance that includes Manticorans, Havenites, Erewhonese and units of the Solarian League Navy to liberate a slave planet and form a new star nation dedicated to the extirpation of slavery. Despite the authors' opposing political views, they have managed, in a rare and impressive display of bipartisanism, to blend Edmund Burke and Carlos Marighella into an intriguing synthesis that should appeal to readers of both persuasions. This outstanding effort transcends the label "space opera" and truly is a novel of ideas. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dearly Devoted Dexter: A Novel</h2><p>He&#x2019;s a charming monster . . . <br><br>A macabre hero . . . <br><br>A serial killer <i>who only kills bad people</i><br>Dexter Morgan has been under considerable pressure. It&#x2019;s just not easy being an ethical serial killer&#x2014;especially while trying to avoid the unshakable suspicions of the dangerous Sergeant Doakes (who believes Dexter is a homicidal maniac . . . which, of course, he is). In an attempt to throw Doakes off his trail, Dexter has had to slip deep into his foolproof disguise. While not working as a blood-spatter analyst for the Miami Police Department, he now spends nearly all his time with his cheerful girlfriend, Rita, and her two children, sipping light beer and slowly becoming the world&#x2019;s first serial couch potato. But how long can Dexter play Kick the Can instead of Slice the Slasher? How long before his Dark Passenger forces him to drop the charade and let his inner monster run free?<br><br>In trying times, opportunity knocks. A particularly nasty psychopath is cutting a trail through Miami&#x2014;a man whose twisted technique leaves even Dexter speechless. As Dexter&#x2019;s dark appetite is revived, his sister, Deborah (a newly minted, tough-as-nails Miami detective) is drawn headlong into the case. It quickly becomes clear that it will take a monster to catch a monster&#x2014;but it isn&#x2019;t until his archnemesis is abducted that Dex can finally throw himself into the search for a new plaything. Unless, of course, his plaything finds him first . . . <br><br>With the incredible wit and freshness that drew widespread acclaim to <i>Darkly Dreaming Dexter</i>, Jeff Lindsay now takes Dexter Morgan to a new level of macabre appeal and gives us one of the most original, colorful narrators in years.<i><br></i></p><p><p>JEFF LINDSAY is the author of <i>Darkly Dreaming Dexter</i>. He lives in South Florida with his wife and three daughters.</p>CHAPTER 1<br><br>It&#x2019;s that moon again, slung so fat and low in the tropical night, calling out across a curdled sky and into the quivering ears of that dear old voice in the shadows, the Dark Passenger, nestled snug in the backseat of the Dodge K-car of Dexter&#x2019;s hypothetical soul.<br><br>That rascal moon, that loudmouthed leering Lucifer, calling down across the empty sky to the dark hearts of the night monsters below, calling them away to their joyful playgrounds. Calling, in fact, to that monster right there, behind the oleander, tiger-striped with moonlight through the leaves, his senses all on high as he waits for just the right moment to leap from the shadows. It is Dexter in the dark, listening to the terrible whispered suggestions that come pouring down breathlessly into my shadowed hiding place.<br><br>My dear dark other self urges me to pounce&#x2013;now&#x2013;sink my moonlit fangs into the oh-so-vulnerable flesh on the far side of the hedge. But the time is not right and so I wait, watching cautiously as my unsuspecting victim creeps past, eyes wide, knowing that something is watching but not knowing that I am <i>here</i>, only three steely feet away in the hedge. I could so easily slide out like the knife blade I am, and work my wonderful magic&#x2013;but I wait, suspected but unseen.<br><br>One long stealthy moment tiptoes into another and still I wait for just the right time; the leap, the outstretched hand, the cold glee as I see the terror spread across the face of my victim&#x2013;<br><br>But no. Something is not right.<br><br>And now it is Dexter&#x2019;s turn to feel the queasy prickling of eyes on his back, the flutter of fear as I become more certain that something is now hunting <i>me</i>. Some other night stalker is feeling the sharp interior drool as he watches <i>me</i> from somewhere nearby&#x2013;and I do not like this thought.<br><br>And like a small clap of thunder the gleeful hand comes down out of nowhere and onto <i>me</i> blindingly fast, and I glimpse the gleaming teeth of a nine-year-old neighbor boy. &#x201c;Gotcha! One, two, three on Dexter!&#x201d; And with the savage speed of the very young the rest of them are there, giggling wildly and shouting at me as I stand in the bushes humiliated. It is over. Six-year-old Cody stares at me, disappointed, as though Dexter the Night God has let down his high priest. Astor, his nine-year-old sister, joins in the hooting of the kids before they skitter off into the dark once more, to new and more complicated hiding places, leaving me so very alone in my shame.<br><br>Dexter did not kick the can. And now Dexter is <i>It</i>. Again.<br><br>You may wonder, how can this be? How can Dexter&#x2019;s night hunt be reduced to this? Always before there has been some frightful twisted predator awaiting the special attention of frightful twisted Dexter&#x2013;and here I am, stalking an empty Chef Boyardee ravioli can that is guilty of nothing worse than bland sauce. Here I am, frittering away precious time losing a game I have not played since I was ten. Even worse, I am IT.<br><br>&#x201c;One. Two. Three&#x2013;&#x201d; I call out, ever the fair and honest gamesman.<br><br>How can this be? How can Dexter the Demon feel the weight of that moon and not be off among the entrails, slicing the life from someone who needs very badly to feel the edge of Dexter&#x2019;s keen judgment? How is it possible on this kind of night for the Cold Avenger to refuse to take the Dark Passenger out for a spin?<br><br>&#x201c;Four. Five. Six.&#x201d;<br><br>Harry, my wise foster father, had taught me the careful balance of Need and Knife. He had taken a boy in whom he saw the unstoppable need to kill&#x2013;no changing that&#x2013;and Harry had molded him into a man who only killed the killers; Dexter the no-bloodhound, who hid behind a human-seeming face and tracked down the truly naughty serial killers who killed without code. And I would have been one of them, if not for the Harry Plan. <i>There are plenty of people who deserve it, Dexter</i>, my wonderful foster-cop-father had said.<br><br>&#x201c;Seven. Eight. Nine.&#x201d;<br><br>He had taught me how to find these special playmates, how to be sure they deserved a social call from me and my Dark Passenger. And even better, he taught me how to get<br>away with it, as only a cop could teach. He had helped me to build a plausible hidey-hole of a life, and drummed into me that I must fit in, always, be relentlessly normal in all things.<br><br>And so I had learned how to dress neatly and smile and brush my teeth. I had become a perfect fake human, saying the stupid and pointless things that humans say to each other all day long. No one suspected what crouched behind my perfect imitation smile. No one except my foster sister, Deborah, of course, but she was coming to accept the real me. After all, I could have been much worse. I could have been a vicious raving monster who killed and killed and left towers of rotting flesh in my wake. Instead, here I was on the side of truth, justice, and the American way. Still a monster, of course, but I cleaned up nicely afterward, and I was OUR monster, dressed in red, white, and blue 100 percent synthetic virtue. And on those nights when the moon is loudest I find the others, those who prey on the innocent and do not play by the rules, and I make them go away in small, carefully wrapped pieces.<br><br>This elegant formula had worked well through years of happy inhumanity. In between playdates I maintained my perfectly average lifestyle from a persistently ordinary apartment. I was never late to work, I made the right jokes with coworkers, and I was useful and unobtrusive in all things, just as Harry had taught me. My life as an android was neat, balanced, and had real redeeming social value.<br><br>Until now. Somehow, here I was on a just-right night playing kick the can with a flock of children, instead of playing Slice the Slasher with a carefully chosen friend. And in a little while, when the game was over, I would take Cody and Astor into their mother, Rita&#x2019;s, house, and she would bring me a can of beer, tuck the kids into bed, and sit beside me on the couch.<br><br>How could this be? Was the Dark Passenger slipping into early retirement? Had Dexter mellowed? Had I somehow turned the corner of the long dark hall and come out on the wrong end as Dexter Domestic? Would I ever again place that one drop of blood on the neat glass slide, as I always did&#x2013;my trophy from the hunt?<br><br>&#x201c;Ten! Ready or not, here I come!&#x201d;<br><br>Yes, indeed. Here I came.<br><br>But to what?<br>It started, of course, with Sergeant Doakes. Every superhero must have an archenemy, and he was mine. I had done absolutely nothing to him, and yet he had chosen to hound me, harry me from my good work. Me and my shadow. And the irony of it: me, a hardworking blood-spatter-pattern analyst for the very same police force that employed him&#x2013;we were on the same team. Was it fair for him to pursue me like this, merely because every now and then I did a little bit of moonlighting?<br><br>I knew Sergeant Doakes far better than I really wanted to, much more than just from our professional connection. I had made it my business to find out about him for one simple reason: he had never liked me, in spite of the fact that I take great pride in being charming and cheerful on a world-class level. But it almost seemed like Doakes could tell it was all fake; all my handmade heartiness bounced off him like June bugs off a windshield.<br><br>This naturally made me curious. I mean, really; what kind of person could possibly dislike me? And so I had studied him just a little, and I found out. The kind of person who could possibly dislike Debonair Dexter was forty-eight, African American, and held the department&#x2019;s record for the bench press. According to the casual gossip I had picked up, he was an army vet, and since coming to the department had been involved in several fatal shootings, all of which Internal Affairs had judged to be righteous.<br><br>But more important than all this, I had discovered firsthand that somewhere behind the deep anger that always burned in his eyes there lurked an echo of a chuckle from my own Dark Passenger. It was just a tiny little chime of a very small bell, but I was sure. Doakes was sharing space with something, just like I was. Not the same thing, but something very similar, a panther to my tiger. Doakes was a cop, but he was also a cold killer. I had no real proof of this, but I was as sure as I could be without seeing him crush a jaywalker&#x2019;s larynx.<br><br>A reasonable being might think that he and I could find some common ground; have a cup of coffee and compare our Passengers, exchange trade talk and chitchat about dismemberment techniques. But no: Doakes wanted me dead. And I found it difficult to share his point of view.<br><br>Doakes had been working with Detective LaGuerta at the time of her somewhat suspicious death, and since then his feelings toward me had grown to be a bit more active than simple loathing. Doakes was convinced that I&#x2019;d had something to do with LaGuerta&#x2019;s death. This was totally untrue and completely unfair. All I had done was watch&#x2013;where&#x2019;s the harm in that? Of course I had helped the real killer escape, but what could you expect? What kind of person would turn in his own brother? Especially when he did such neat work.<br><br>Well, live and let live, I always say. Or quite often, anyway. Sergeant Doakes could think what he wanted to think, and that was fine with me. There are still very few laws against thinking, although I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;re working hard on that in Washington. No, whatever suspicions the good sergeant had about me, he was welcome to them. But now that he had decided to act on his impure thoughts my life was a shambles. Dexter Derailed was fast becoming Dexter Demented.<br><br>And why? How had this whole nasty mess begun? All I had done was try to be myself.</p><h2>Four Pillars of a Man&#39;s Heart: Bringing Strength into Balance</h2><p>Building upon the "Four Pillars of Manhood" model set forth in his bestseller Tender Warrior, author Stu Weber leads readers in an expanded, in-depth biblical exploration of what it means to be a king, warrior, mentor, and friend.

This title chronicles accounts of swindles, schemes, and scams on a grand scale. It also surveys controversial people and movements of the past: necromancy, Father Hell and Magnetism, Anthony Mesmer and Mesmerism, and the Crusades.</p><p>Why do otherwise intelligent individuals form seething masses of idiocy when they engage in collective action? Why do financially sensible people jump lemming-like into hare-brained speculative frenzies--only to jump broker-like out of windows when their fantasies dissolve? We may think that the Great Crash of 1929, junk bonds of the '80s, and over-valued high-tech stocks of the '90s are peculiarly 20th century aberrations, but Mackay's classic--first published in 1841--shows that the madness and confusion of crowds knows no limits, and has no temporal bounds. These are extraordinarily illuminating,and, unfortunately, entertaining tales of chicanery, greed and naivete. Essential reading for any student of human nature or the transmission of ideas. <p> </p><p> In fact, cases such as Tulipomania in 1624--when Tulip bulbs traded at a higher price than gold--suggest the existence of what I would dub "Mackay's Law of Mass Action:" when it comes to the effect of social behavior on the intelligence of individuals, 1+1 is often less than 2, and sometimes considerably less than 0.</p>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Samantha&#39;s Short Story Collection</h2><p>Relates the adventures of Samantha Parkington, a young orphan who is raised by her wealthy grandmother in New York City in the early years of the twentieth century and whose antics confound her grandmother, who wants Samantha to behave as a &#34;young lady.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Richard Yates: A Novel</h2><p>In a startling change of direction, cult favorite Tao Lin presents a dark and brooding tale of illicit love that is his most sophisticated and mesmerizing writing yet. <br> <br> <i>Richard Yates</i> is named after real-life writer Richard Yates, but it has nothing to do with him. Instead, it tracks the rise and fall of an illicit affair between a very young writer and his even younger--in fact, under-aged--lover. As he seeks to balance work and love, she becomes more and more self-destructive in a play for his undivided attention. His guilt and anger builds in response until they find themselves hurtling out of control and afraid to let go.<br> <br> Lin's trademark minimalism takes on a new, sharp-edged suspense here, zeroing in on a lacerating narrative like never before --until it is almost, in fact, too late.</p><p><b>Guest Reviewer: Bill Clegg</b> <br> <p></p> Bill Clegg, the author of <i>Portrait of an Addict as a Young Man</i> reviews Tao Lin&#x2019;s new novel, <i>Richard Yates</i>. <p></p> Tao Lin&#x2019;s second novel is called <i>Richard Yates</i>. The two main characters are named Dakota Fanning and Haley Joel Osment. Dakota Fanning. Haley Joel Osment. Richard Yates. Three names. To varying degrees and depending on when and in which circles they get mentioned, famous names. Richard Yates was a writer who achieved some fame, was basically forgotten and then, after his death, became appreciated again. Tao Lin used to use his own name and other not famous names for his protagonists and now he doesn&#x2019;t. Or at least in this novel he didn&#x2019;t. Haley Joel Osment is a more famous name than Tao Lin. There is much to suggest &#x2013; in this book and most everywhere &#x2013; that fame is a wanted thing. To be seen. To be recognized. To be witnessed. To be special. And now, because of the many portals available to access that status, being seen/witnessed/famous/special is achievable, to varying degrees, for everyone. Haley and Dakota meet through one of those portals online. They talk and text like most everyone. Like this. Like that. He said. She said. You get the idea. And so, the story: He&#x2019;s 22. She&#x2019;s 16. They text. They chat. They talk. Eventually, they meet. She binges, barfs, steals stuff, lies. He catches her. He tells her he cares. She promises to stop all the stuff he catches her doing. He reads a novel by Richard Yates. Doubt ensues. A gulf widens. Their future together looks less likely. A formal feeling follows. Everyone ends up a little sadder than before. <p></p> There&#x2019;s a poem by Daniel Halpern called <i>White Field</i> that was written long before the internet happened. I kept thinking about it when I read <i>Richard Yates</i>. It&#x2019;s about the end of a relationship, starting fresh and looking back at that time and that thing that is now over. That time and that thing are depicted as footprints in snow, filling with new snow, soon to disappear. There&#x2019;s a line in the poem, near the middle, that reads, <i>All day long you tell yourself how you feel</i>. In <i>Richard Yate</i>, Haley and Dakota tell themselves how they feel. All day long. All night long. In chat rooms, in e-mails, in texts, on the phone. They hear each other for a little while and then hear themselves more. And so the novel, with its famous name characters and its once famous, now famous again name title, wants to be seen and paid attention to; and if you happen to look, you&#x2019;ll see that it&#x2019;s saying&#x2013; shrewdly, brilliantly, in the numb meticulousness of a generation that posts photographs on-line of half-sucked cough drops, about-to-be-eaten meals, and pillows they are about to lay their heads on &#x2013; that you do, too. <p></p>Tao Lin is the author of the novels <i>Richard Yates</i> and <i>Eeeee Eee Eeee</i>, the novella <i>Shoplifting from American Apparel</i>, the story collection <i>Bed</i>, and the poetry collections <i>cognitive-behavioral therapy</i> and <i>you are a little bit happier than i am</i>.

She is currently writing the Young Adult Supernatural Fantasy novel WINTER WILDER.Though these Archie Comics stories are almost 10 years old, this successful collection is nevertheless fun and engaging, with a long story arc. In this version, Sabrina is a high-school sophomore but on the young side. She&#x2019;s caught between her crush on a mortal boy and a magical one, the latter of whom disconcertingly appears to be crushing on Sabrina&#x2019;s best friend. Aside from sweet-and-sour romance, the chapters introduce Sabrina&#x2019;s legal-guardian aunts, one of whom has political aspirations, and, of course, the wizard turned cat, Salem, who serves as both a comfort and an abrasive companion as Sabrina embarks on mortal and magical adventures ranging from recovering a kidnapped magical creature to waiting for her mortal sweetheart to invite her to the winter ball. The storytelling is well crafted, and the volume ends on a cliff-hanger, as its readers would likely prefer. The art is manga-like but well within the standards a middle-school library can offer students.

My own particular relationship to being a sexual person; and a radical stand in direct contradiction to, and in violation of, the women I was raised to be." Through the poetry, prose, and personal stories in <b>Loving in the War Years</b>, Cherrie Moraga explores this contradiction, weaving her confusion and pain with her eventual self-acceptance. She writes about prejudices she suffers because she is half-white and a lesbian born in a Catholic, Chicano culture. She tells of her frustrations with the importance men were given as she was growing up and the exclusion of lesbian women of color from the women's movement. In her struggles, she draws from those parts of her upbringing which are necessary to her physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being - the love of her mother's home, the sense of community among Chicana women, the smell of the candles in church, and the spiritual need to respect something beyond herself - creating a portrait of beauty, anger, and independence. "Spirituality which inspires activism and, similarly, politics which move the spirit - which draw from the deep-seated place of our greatest longings for freedom - give meaning to our lives." Some knowledge of Spanish may be helpful with these writings, but even without it Cherrie Moraga's words will touch your heart and your mind. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Holly Smith</i></p><h2>HEIDI</h2><p>A Swiss orphan is heartbroken when she must leave her beloved grandfather and their happy home in the mountains to go to school and to care for an invalid girl in the city.</p><p>Johanna Spyri's classic story of a young orphan sent to live with her grumpy grandfather in the Swiss Alps is retold in it's entirety in this beautifully bound hardcover edition. <i>Heidi</i> has charmed and intrigued readers since it's original publication in 1880.

It was first published on 14 October 1892, though the individual stories had been serialised in The Strand Magazine between June 1891 and July 1892. The stories are not in chronological order, and the only characters common to all twelve are Holmes and Dr. Watson. As with all but four of the Sherlock Holmes stories, those contained within The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes are told by a first-person narrative from the point of view of Dr. Watson. In general the stories in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes identify, and try to correct, social injustices. Holmes is portrayed as offering a new, fairer sense of justice. The stories were well received, and boosted the subscriptions figures of The Strand Magazine, prompting Doyle to be able to demand more money for his next set of stories. The first story, "A Scandal in Bohemia", includes the character of Irene Adler, who, despite being featured only within this one story by Doyle, is a prominent character in modern Sherlock Holmes adaptations, generally as a love interest for Holmes. Doyle included four of the twelve stories from this collection in his twelve favourite Sherlock Holmes stories, picking "The Adventure of the Speckled Band" as his overall favourite.</p></p><p>7 1.5-hour cassettesThe stories known collectively as <b>The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</b> turned the literary detective into a household name and are the best-loved of Conan Doyle's Holmes stories.

After all, Jesus was a master storyteller. He frequently and effectively used the art of storytelling to communicate deep truths about God, humanity, love, and eternity to a culture on the brink. His stories defied social norms, revealed God&#x2019;s Kingdom, and fiercely advocated for the least of these.</p><p>With examples from Scripture as the foundation, <em>Speak</em> is a call for grace, openness, and vulnerability within the evangelical church. Nish Weiseth encourages those in the Body of Christ to know their own story of transformation and redemption&#x2015;and to use those stories as a catalyst for change at both a personal and global level.</p></p><p><p>Nish Weiseth grew up everywhere from Arizona to North Carolina. She went to the University of Colorado at Boulder where she did her undergraduate work in religious studies, philosophy and Italian and met her dark, mysterious, adrenaline-junkie husband, Erik.&nbsp;Nish is a writer, blogger, and entrepreneur.

The anthology shows the pioneers' view of their invasion not as destroying the rich culture and the delicate balance of nature which the natives (human and animal) shared but, in keeping with the times, as bringing civilization. But no moralizing here--what was done is merely reported. One cannot be too complimentary, however, toward a book as comprehensive and as delightfully informative as this one. As a substitute for those who have no access to the originals and a sound basis for those who want background, this would be a good buy for most libraries. Libraries could also supplement this with Nigel Pavitt's Kenya: The First Explorers (St. Martin's, 1989), which is more limited in scope but has colorful photos and sketches.

These infamous posters were, in turn, central fixtures in Chinese homes, railway stations, schools, journals, magazines, and just about anywhere else where people were likely to see them. Chairman Mao, portrayed as a stoic superhero (a.k.a. the Great Teacher, the Great Leader, the Great Helmsman, the Supreme Commander), appeared in all kinds of situations (inspecting factories, smoking a cigarette with peasant workers, standing by the Yangzi River in a bathrobe, presiding over the bow of a ship, or floating over a sea of red flags), flanked by strong, healthy, ageless men and &#34;masculinized&#34; women and children wearing baggy, sexless, drab clothing. The goal of each poster was to show the Chinese people what sort of behavior was considered morally correct and how great the future of Communist China would be if everyone followed the same path toward utopia by uniting together. Combining fact and fiction in a way typical of propaganda art, these posters exuded positive vibes and seemed to suggest that Mao was an omnipresent force that would accompany China to happiness and greatness. This book brings together a selection of colorful propaganda artworks and cultural artifacts from photographer Michael Wolf&#39;s vast collection of Chinese propaganda posters, many of which are now extremely rare. Michael Wolf has lived in Hong Kong for eight years and works as a photographer for Stern. He collects posters and photographs from the period of the Cultural Revolution till today.</p><p></p><h2>The Complete Sailing Manual, 4th Edition</h2><p><p>An essential reference book for sailing enthusiasts, now in its fourth edition with a foreword by quadruple Olympic gold medalist Ben Ainslie.</p><p>Learn the basics of sailing, master navigation, and maintain your boat with <i>The Complete Sailing Manual</i>, written by instructor and former British national champion Steve Sleight.

Rap, Race and Resistance in Los Angeles (Haymarket Series)</h2><p>This photo-essay, coupled with oral histories, provides a map of the contemporary hip-hop nation in Los Angeles. Bracketed by introductory essays on the history and production of the music and a glossary, the book aims to engage with the city&#x2018;s rap scene on its own terms, with interviews and images, documenting its movements and influences, its leaders and up-and-comers. From its beginnings, Los Angeles has been a site of multiple voices, disputes and injustices. The history of rap in this city sets out to tell these stories, providing a voice first for African Americans then, through hip-hop, for many others. Artists interviewed include: Roy Porter; The Watts Prophets; Gill Scott Heron; Ice T.; Nefertiti; Ice Cube; DJ Quik; and Eazy E.</p><p>Irish-born music journalist/photographer Goss, picture editor of the hiphop magazine <i>Rappages</i>, builds a mosaic of interviews and photos documenting the development of rap music in Los Angeles. Goss opens with brief histories of L.A. hiphop and Chicano hiphop ("a separate but parallel story") and closes the book with T-Love's thoughts on freestyling, a list of incidents of police brutality in Los Angeles from 1965 to 1991 (compiled from the statistics of the Coalition Against Police Abuse) and a brief discography. But at the heart of Goss' book are his interviews and roundtables with and comments from rap progenitors such as Roy Porter, Horace Tapscott, the Watts Prophets, and Michael Mixxin Moor; major "names" such as Ice T, Dr Dre, Eazy E, and Ice Cube, L.A. producers, DJs, and promoters; and newer voices such as YoYo, Da Lench Mob, OFTB, The Pharcyde, and the Freestyle Fellowship. Goss makes the case that most attacks on hiphop culture make no effort to understand it; his book displays hiphop's continuity with earlier forms of African American music, its complexity, and the several bases of its appeal to teens of many ethnic backgrounds. Libraries struggling to attract youth may want to add <i>It's Not about a Salary</i>. <i>Mary Carroll</i>This examination of race and rap music in Los Angeles begins with Cross's look at the societal underpinnings, including civil unrest and mistrust of authorities, most notably the Los Angeles police. In an essay that attempts to combine both academic and ethnic street sensibilities, he notes, for instance, the influence of the Watts Writers Workshop, founded after the 1965 riots. More illuminating, however, are the interviews with seminal figures such as the Watts Prophets (one of whose members, Amdee, says, "We realized that disco music was drowning out spoken word . . . we wanted to bring the word back out in front"), as well as more current rappers, including Cypress Hill, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Eazy E. Cross shows that in less than 20 years hip-hop has grown to encompass both outrage and entrepreneurship in an ever-changing synthesis of pop art and intellectual discourse. However, Cross, an Irish-born writer and photographer, spends too much time establishing his credentials for being "legit" in this predominantly nonwhite universe. Perhaps more insightful are his photographs of some of the rapper's homes, which more subtly illustrate their origins and sentiments. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Highway Rat</h2><p>Quick!

His illustrations have been published in more than thirty countries. He lives in London, England.PreS-Gr 2-Inspired by Alfred Noyes's "The Highwayman," Donaldson tells the tale of a swashbuckling rat with mask and cape who stops hapless travelers and takes their food at sword point. While he prefers chocolates, puddings, and cakes, he steals clover from a rabbit, nuts from a squirrel, and even hay from his own horse. "The creatures who traveled the highway/grew thinner and thinner and thinner,/While the Highway Rat grew horribly fat/from eating up everyone's dinner." A brave duck in a red kerchief lures the thief to a distant cave, supposedly full of biscuits and buns. While he follows the echoes of his own voice deeper and deeper into the dark, the duck jumps on Rat's horse and takes the stolen food back to her hungry friends. Eventually he emerges on the other side of the hill, becomes a reformed rodent, and finds work sweeping the floor at a cake shop. Scheffler's rich, dark palette creates a brooding atmosphere just right for the Highway Rat's dastardly deeds, and his cartoon-style characters are a wonderful tongue-in-cheek contrast. Humorous details abound, including Gruffalo cookies in the cake shop from this British duo's The Gruffalo (Puffin, 2006).

In this volume you will learn about... - The Administrative levels of the Emerald Order Melchizadek Cloister - The benevolent Guardians and the self-interested Intruders - True human origins and the on-going Hybridization Program - The plight of the Zeta Reticuli, and their plans for Earth - Keylontic Science-the science of dimensional reality - The role of awareness, emotion and intuition - Exercises to raise your frequency and prepare for changes</p><p>This expanded second edition of the sold-out first edition is a necessary companion to the awesome Volume II, second edition, which covers Earth history back 550 million years up through 9/11 and the WTC attacks, within a multidimensional cosmic framework. This first volume sets up the groundwork necessary to understand the astonishing information in Volume II: Who is who out there? What agendas are they playing? How do we fit in? What are our choices?Voyagers is a set of books best approached by asking the question: What do we really know about the nature of reality? Many of the ideas presented in this book are different from the old belief paradigms through which we have been taught to view reality. They do not negate the old, but rather challenge old ideas to evolve. I suggest that the reader take an open-minded approach to the information contained in this book, in order to receive the benefits of the Voyagers material. The greatest benefit of the Voyagers perspective is the gift of an uncommon knowledge, through which mysterious aspects of reality can be comprehended. Challenges inspire growth, and Voyagers is a challenge. It is a book to grow with in your quest for understanding. Not the average book, its implications are so intrinsically profound that at times they seem unbelievable, but this is not a fiction story, not just a book of ideas. It is evidence of a most intimate and extraordinary journey through personal experiences. This book is not about my personal experiences, rather it is the result of those experiences.

Based on the Apologetics Pyramid method developed during Meister&#39;s work in the Defender&#39;s Ministry at Willow Creek Community Church, Building Belief begins not with assumptions of people&#39;s biblical knowledge but with their experiences. Author Chad V. Meister developed his strategy to begin where most contemporary unbelievers find themselves-filled with uncertainty and doubt. From there he seeks to lead them objectively through levels of reasoning to the apex of the pyramid: the ultimate truth of God found in Christ. By meeting people where they are in life, Meister creates a resource that promotes greater understanding and spiritual development. Lay readers, spiritual seekers, and Christians who want to strengthen their own faith will appreciate this fresh take on a traditional apologetics approach.</p><p>Take a journey from doubt to belief It can be hard to share your faith with others, especially when people can&#39;t agree on whether there is even any actual truth. With that in mind, Chad Meister has developed a simple, logical way for you to help others move past relativism to a place where Christian belief makes sense: the Apologetics Pyramid. In Building Belief, Meister leads you up each step of the pyramid, beginning where many find themselves today--doubting if anything is really true. From there, he powerfully builds a case for absolute truth, the existence of God, universal morals and values, the reliability and divine inspiration of the Bible, the resurrection of Christ, and ultimately, the good news that Jesus is the Son of God who offers salvation to the world. &#34;Join Chad Meister in this concise, clear, and compelling book as he builds a persuasive case for the truth of Christianity.&#34;--Lee Strobel, author, The Case for Christ and The Case for Faith &#34;An excellent book to lead earnest enquirers from doubt to conviction about the basic truths of the Christian faith.&#34;--Norman L.

P. Moreland, distinguished professor of philosophy, Talbot School of Theology; author, Love Your God with All Your Mind &#34;Building Belief is thoughtful, fresh, and full of personal and practical illustrations.

Richards, research fellow, Acton Institute; coauthor, The Privileged PlanetChad Meister (Ph.D., Marquette University) is the former head of Defenders (now called Truthquest), an apologetics ministry at Willow Creek Community Church.While pursuing his Ph.D. in philosophy, Chad developed the Apologetics Pyramid method highlighted in this book. It is based on his own journey from a spiritually seeking engineer to that of a convinced Christian philosopher.

He could hurt her, but not even Colin Mac Brodie was so cruel a man to hit a woman.</p><p>Still she was a coward.</p><p>"Milksop," she muttered to herself, "worse than a bloody Sassenach!" And she frowned in wholehearted disapproval at the feet that stood planted so firmly upon her mother soil.</p><p>She had come to this wedding not to celebrate, for while these were not her enemies, neither were they her friends. Nay, she came to speak with Colin Mac Brodie. It galled her that she should need his help, but she was not so proud that she was willing to lose the man she wanted for the sake of her pride. Everyone was getting married, it seemed--the MacKinnon, Meghan, and soon enough Alison MacLean. It was only a matter of time before Broc should wed, as well.</p><p>Now was the time to act.</p><p>So what was she waiting for?</p><p>Seana frowned as she contemplated the answer.</p><p>Her gaze wandered to the happy bride and lingered wistfully upon her. Meghan had been the envy of every woman in Scotia, with her beautiful dark hair and her perfect face. If aught at all, the Brodie women had been cursed with loveliness, Seana thought, not madness as had been the rumor. Och, but there was nothing in Meghan's eyes that betrayed madness at all, and Seana truly believed the eyes were windows to the soul.</p><p>As kind as the years had been to Seana, they'd been even more so to Meghan Brodie. Though it was difficult not to envy Meghan, for she was everything Seana was not, somehow Seana could not. While Colin's sister was beautiful, she'd lived as lonely a life as Seana had, except that Meghan had had the love of her grandmother and the friendship of MacLean's youngest daughter. Seana had had her da, of a certain, but her da had never been her strength. Rather, Seana had been his.</p><p>Speaking of which...She turned her face up to the sky to gauge the hour. It was growing late and her da was like to be hungry by now.</p><p>If she didn't bring home some nourishment for him, he would not eat, she knew.</p><p>For most, the gaiety was only just beginning, but if Seana didn't make her way home soon, her da would be asleep for the night and without supper. Nor did she relish the thought of making her way through the woodlands when night had deepened the shadows of the forest to black. She was not afeared, of course, but practically, it was simply too dark to keep to the path.</p><p>Meghan's celebration had been a grand one. Her brothers had denied her naught, despite that it had come about so suddenly. The festivity had begun early in the day and would continue until the wee hours of the morn, she knew, until the men were drunk enough to kiss the ground and their women were forced to drag them home by their feet. She would have loved to have brought her da, but her da would no longer leave their home, so Seana was forced to come alone, and to bring him home her tales.</p><p>Och, but she was a coward!</p><p>Belonging to neither the MacKinnon nor the Brodie clan, and having lived practically alone most of her life, Seana had few friends, fewer yet who were so close to Broc as Colin. In fact, she doubted anybody knew Broc better than Colin did--though Colin was certainly his own best friend, and none other's. Still who better to teach her how to win the man she loved than the man who knew him best?</p><p>And neither did anyone know better what attracted a man to a woman than did Colin Brodie--rotter that he was!</p><p>There was no way around it...she needed help, and Colin was the only one she thought could provide it. She'd tried all her wiles with Broc; nothing seemed to work. Broc remained blissfully unaware of her interest, if not of her presence. He was such a sweet clod of a man, Broc was, and the thought of him, as always, brought a gentle smile to her lips.</p><p>She shook her head in disgust as she considered her options...short of asking him outright to wed with her, she had tried all else she knew to do. </p></p><h2>Buffy The Vampire Slayer Omnibus Volume 5</h2><p>Volume Five of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Omnibus series begins immediately after Season Three, after Sunnydale High has gone up in flames.

It was cold, but the boy could detect a faint drifting fall of moisture from the dark sky.</p><p>The man was still sitting there.</p><p>Was this the fifth day in a row? Yuri counted backwards and decided that it was. It had snowed three days earlier, putting another white layer on the park. The man had been there before and during the snow.</p><p>Every afternoon as Yuri walked home from school the man had been sitting there. Sometimes he was reading a paperback book. Sometimes he seemed to be just thinking. He was a block of a man made even bulkier by the thick coat and fur hat he wore.</p><p>The man with a broad face similar to that of hundreds of thousands of Rus sians did not look up from his book. Yuri approached and sat at the end of the bench away from the man, who turned a page slowly.</p><p>Darkness was no more than an hour away and people were trudging or scurrying home from work after emerging from the Bitsevsky Park Metro station at the end of the Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line, the orange line.</p><p>Yuri, eleven years old and supremely confident, felt safe enough. The man was old and certainly slow, his left leg oddly still. Yuri could run with confidence if he felt the need. He was the fastest boy in his form at school. Thin, pale-skinned with blond hair under his earflapped wool hat, he had nothing much to look forward to when he got to the apartment where his mother might be home and his father certainly would not be yet. His grandfather would be in front of the tele vi sion, what ever he was watching the enemy. They would be having a dinner of salad with the vegetables chopped into little pieces, leftover bean soup with sour cream, and saut�ed mushroom stew with onions and sour cream served over mashed potatoes. The mushroom stew was also left over and stored in those plastic see-through containers with blue plastic tops.</p><p>Yuri&#x2019;s mother worked in the Coca-Cola bottling plant in Solnovo, seventeen miles outside of Moscow. Her job was quality control, watching the bottles fill with syrup, water, and carbonation, looking for even the slightest imperfections. She was well paid. She had frequent headaches. On headache days, Yuri sometimes prepared simple dinners or at least opened the plastic containers, heated the contents, and set the table.</p><p>Yuri&#x2019;s father was a bartender in Vodka Bar near the Park Kulutry Metro stop. His father, if he were still home, would leave for work shortly after Yuri came home. Though Yuri was sure his father loved him and his mother, he did a poor job of hiding his desire to get away from his father-in-law each night.</p><p>And so Yuri sat on the bench.</p><p>The man read on.</p><p>"Why are you sitting here?" Yuri said after a minute or two.</p><p>"I am waiting," said the man.</p><p>"For whom?"</p><p>"You," said the man, still not looking at the boy.</p><p>"Me?"</p><p>"Or someone who would be curious enough to wonder who I might be and why I was sitting here on an early winter day."</p><p>Yuri didn&#x2019;t understand, but he was curious.</p><p>"What are you reading?"</p><p>The man held up his ragged paperback. Yuri looked at the cover. The title was in English, a language Yuri was slowly and painfully learning in school.</p><p>"Ice?"</p><p>"Da, yes."</p><p>"You are reading an En glish book about small rodents?"</p><p>"Not &#x2018;mice,&#x2019; " said the man. "Ice. Frozen water. It&#x2019;s a story. I would offer you a Red October chocolate, but you might think I was a dirty old man."</p><p>"Are you?"</p><p>"No," said the man.</p><p>"Then you can offer me a chocolate."</p><p>"What makes you think you can trust me?"</p><p>"You have been coming here for five days. You are slow. I think I can trust you. At least I can get away if you try to do something. People are passing and I am sure I am faster than you are."</p><p>The man shifted his weight and with a grunt reached into his coat pocket and came up with a brown see-through bag, which crinkled invitingly. Yuri had a near passion for chocolate. The man reached into the already open bag and fished out a wrapped candy. Yuri could see the familiar image of the woman marioshki figure on the wrapper.</p><p>"Throw it," Yuri said.</p><p>The man threw the candy and Yuri caught it. Yuri could catch almost anything thrown to him. He fully expected to be the goalkeeper on his lower school team next year. Yuri pocketed his candy. The man opened a second one and popped it into his mouth, stuffing the wrapper into his pocket.</p><p>"You want another for here?"</p><p>Yuri shrugged. The man came up with another wrapped chocolate and threw it to the boy, who caught it.</p><p>"You are a goalkeeper," the man said.</p><p>"Yes," said Yuri, this time unwrapping the chocolate and taking a small bite from the end. The candy cracked between his teeth and spread its taste as he chewed it.</p><p>"My son is a goalkeeper," the man said. "He was a goalkeeper. He&#x2019;s old enough to be your father."</p><p>Yuri wondered how old this man must then be, but he was too polite to ask. "What position did you play?"</p><p>In answer the man leaned forward and rapped his knuckles against his leg. It sounded like a knock at Yuri&#x2019;s front door.</p><p>"No position," said the man. "My leg was lost when I was your age. So you see that there is no way I could chase a ten-year-old goalkeeper down the street."</p><p>"I am eleven and I wasn&#x2019;t worried," said Yuri, popping the last tidbit of candy into his mouth.</p><p>"It is probably a good thing to worry when you are near the park and nightfall is approaching."</p><p>Two women passed them by with barely a glance. The women were both carrying their string grocery bags weighted down with the night&#x2019;s dinner. Both women were fat, possibly sisters. The fatter of the two kept shaking her head as the other woman raised her voice higher and higher. Yuri caught the word baranina. Lamb.</p><p>Yuri and the man watched the two women until they were far down the street and the loud voice was lost in a riff of the wind.</p><p>The man shifted again, holding the candy in his right hand and fishing his wallet out of an inner pocket with his left.</p><p>If he offers lots of money to do some unspeakable thing, I will go find a police car. There was always a police car roaming near the park. This was because . . .</p><p>The man held open the wallet to show a police badge.</p><p>"I am a policeman," said the man. "My name is Porfiry Petrovich Rostnikov."</p><p>"My name is Yuri Platkov. I know why you are sitting here."</p><p>Porfiry Petrovich nodded.</p><p>"Him," said Yuri. "The Bitsevsky Maniac."</p><p>"You know about him?"</p><p>"Everyone who lives near the park knows about him. He attacks the old people who hang out around the park. He beats their heads in with a hammer and hides their bodies in the bushes. Some say he has killed fifty or more. You expect him to walk up to you and confess?"</p><p>"It has happened in the past, but I do not expect it."</p><p>"How would he even know you were a policeman?"</p><p>"He would know," said Porfiry Petrovich.</p><p>"So, you thought someone would just come and sit down and tell you that they knew who the Maniac was?"</p><p>"No, but that would be very nice, nicer even if the murderer himself were to sit where you are and confess. I do not expect it, but it would be nice."</p><p>"Then why sit here if you do not expect someone to come to you?"</p><p>"You came," said the policeman.</p><p>Cars were moving cautiously in front of them, windshield wipers rubbing faster than was called for by the falling cold mist. Both Yuri and Porfiry Petrovich watched a large white Chaika stretch limousine with tinted windows come by.</p><p>" We don&#x2019;t see cars like that here very much," said Yuri. "There&#x2019;s no place a car like that could be going."</p><p>"There&#x2019;s a big dinner at the Posvit Hotel on the other side of the park," said Porfiry Petrovich. "Our government is trying to convince a Japanese investment group to develop an area called Gargarin Street."</p><p>"How many has he killed now?" asked the boy.</p><p>"Many," said the policeman. "I can&#x2019;t tell anyone because the number might be important when we catch him."</p><p>The official internal number of victims, Porfiry Petrovich knew, was officially nineteen. The unreported number of victims was fifty-one. It was assumed that there were other bodies to be found .</p><p>"You are not hoping he will come out of the woods to confess?" Yuri said.</p><p>"No, I am not."</p><p>"Maybe you are hoping he will come by and try to kill you?"</p><p>"I have considered that possibility," said Porfiry Petrovich. "I expect that at some point he will come and sit down as you have. Or perhaps he will pass by letting our eyes make contact."</p><p>"Will you be here tomorrow?" Yuri asked.</p><p>"Perhaps," said Porfiry Petrovich, urging his plastic and metal leg to allow him to rise with some dignity.</p><p>Now that he was standing, Yuri could see that the man was neither tall nor short. He stood with his legs apart, reminding the boy of a cylindrical box of kasha on the kitchen shelf.</p><p>"Shall we shake hands, Yuri Platkov?" Porfiry Petrovich said, holding out a thick right hand.</p><p>Foot traffic had grown heavier. People streamed from the direction of the subway. It was safe enough. He placed his hand in that of the policeman. Yuri steeled himself to squeeze, but it wasn&#x2019;t necessary. The policeman&#x2019;s grip was firm but gentle.</p><p>"The Maniac has moved the bird feeders," said the boy.</p><p>The policeman knew the makeshift bird feeders made of shoe boxes or cereal containers. The feeders, tied by string or ribbon, were hung from the low branches of trees with piles of seed inside left by bird lovers. They existed in almost all parks within the city.</p><p>"Moved them where?" asked the policeman.</p><p>"Farther from the path, deeper into the trees," said the boy. "People have to move away from the eyes of others to put in seeds or watch the birds feed. And some of the old men with no home eat the seeds."</p><p>No further clarification was necessary.</p><p>"I will look at the bird feeders," said the policeman.</p><p>"Paka , good-bye," the boy said.</p><p>"Paka, Yuri Platkov," said Porfiry Petrovich.</p><p>Yuri started to move away and then turned to face the standing man.</p><p>"Are you important?"</p><p>"I am Chief Inspector in the Office of Special Investigations."</p><p>"I have never heard of such an office."</p><p>"Good. That is as it should be."</p><p>Yuri turned and hurried away adjusting the scarf around his neck as he followed the jumble of icy footprints in the thin layer of snow that crackled under his feet.</p><p>Porfiry Petrovich Rostnikov had been handed the case of the Bitsevksy Maniac only six days earlier. For the past two years, the murders had been under the jurisdiction of the MVD, Ministerstvo Vnutrennikh Del, the Ministry of Internal Affairs.</p><p>The existence of the murderer had been kept a secret. But the public began to learn of the Maniac through word of mouth, surviving relatives, and newspapers and small magazines that couldn&#x2019;t be silenced. They learned of it long before Rostnikov was handed the case. The MVD was embarrassed and the way out of the embarrassment was to issue an internal document, which they were certain would be leaked, stating that their resources had to be concentrated on terrorist threats and that the Office of Special Investigations was ready to take on principal responsibility for finding "the murders in and around Bitsevsky Park."</p><p>Fortunately, Igor Yaklovev, Director of the Office of Special Investigations, was quite willing to take on the high-profile case. The Yak was always willing to take on cases that no one else wanted provided there was a payoff in the end, be it an acknowledgment of his skills as an investigator, the possibility of a promotion, or the likelihood of an opportunity to blackmail a government official or a wealthy citizen.</p><p>The Yak, lean and always impeccably dressed in a dark suit and tie, seldom left his office in Petrovka, Moscow&#x2019;s police headquarters, though it was rumored that he engaged in regular martial-arts exercises with Vladimir Putin, with whom he had served in the KGB in St. Petersburg. The Yak relied completely on Rostnikov and his team to successfully take care of the investigations for which the Yak took credit. In turn, Colonel Yaklovev did his best to protect Rostnikov and his team when trouble arose.</p><p>Now in his own office down the hall from the Yak&#x2019;s, Rostnikov continued to go over the MVD reports on the investigation. The stack was at least three inches high, and he was sure that everything had not been turned over to him. It was only natural that MVD officers and the Yak would pull out possibly vital documents to hold for possible gain or simply to hamper the investigation in the hope of failure.</p><p>Still, there was much in the pile of folders and reports, including the photographs of all the victims and the autopsy reports. Rost-nikov had divided the pile of reports in two and given one stack to Emil Karpo, the gaunt, almost cadaverous inspector who would certainly read every word placed in his hands. Rostnikov, however, would move through instinctively, catching a word here, something in the corner of a photograph there. Sometimes he knew what to look for, but more often he would simply sense what he needed to know, though he would acknowledge there were times in the past when he missed some vital piece of information. In a few days, he would switch piles with Karpo and go through the same pro cess again. They were a good team. Karpo was an analyst of fact with no imagination. Rostnikov trusted his imagination and doubted facts.</p><p>The others on his team who shared an office with Karpo were on other cases. Rostnikov&#x2019;s son, Iosef, mistakenly named for Stalin when the Man of Steel was still considered the savior of the Soviet Union, was investigating the death of a professional boxer and the wife of a giant of a man who was on the verge of becoming heavyweight champion of the world. That investigation had just begun. Iosef was assisted by Akardy Zelach, the Slouch, a lumbering man of no great investigative skills but often surprising talents.</p><p>Zelach&#x2019;s mother was in the hospital almost certainly dying from an ailment that the doctors could not identify. Zelach, who was forty-one years old, lived with and listened to his mother. He could not even imagine what life might be like without her. On the other hand, Sasha Tkach dreamt of living without the daily unannounced appearances of his mother.</p><p>Sasha&#x2019;s mother, Lydia Tkach, was a retired government apparachnik who was given to shouting directions to her son about how to live, what to eat, and what he could do to try to win back his wife and Lydia&#x2019;s two grandchildren. Lydia was nearly deaf. Lydia had a pair of very effective hearing aids. Lydia refused to wear them. Sasha was sure this was because she had no interest in hearing what anyone else had to say.</p><p>Sasha was still morose and not a joy to be with since his wife, Maya, had moved to Kiev with their two children. Sasha had willingly fallen victim to one woman too many.</p><p>Elena Timofeyeva had her own concerns, primarily the coming wedding to Iosef Rostnikov, son of Porfiry Petrovich to whom she was to be married in five days. It was required that they were to be wed exactly thirty-two days from the time that they registered with with ZAGS, the all-powerful office that controlled marriages. At the moment, however, Elena and Sasha were assigned to protect a British journalist about to look at or ganized prostitution in Moscow.</p><p>Any of them could be pulled from there to concentrate on the Maniac if and when they were needed.&lt;...</p></p><h2>Barbara and Susan&#39;s Guide to the Empty Nest: Discovering New Purpose, Passion, and Your Next Great Adventure</h2><p><b>Discover New Passion and Purpose after the Kids Leave Home<br></b><br>Many women approaching their empty-nest years do so with mixed emotions--feeling grief for what is no more but also excitement for what lies ahead.

The harsh realities of the age&#x2014;anti-Semitic persecution, economic discrimination, and an ominous climate of violence&#x2014;devastated Jewish communities and shattered the lives of individuals. <br><br>The Jewish crisis was as much the result of internal decay as of external attack. Demographic collapse, social disintegration, and cultural dissolution were all taking their toll. The problem was not just Nazism: In the summer of 1939 more Jews were behind barbed wire outside the Third Reich than within it, and not only in police states but even in the liberal democracies of the West. The greater part of Europe was being transformed into a giant concentration <br><br>camp for Jews. Unlike most previous accounts, <i>On the Eve </i>focuses not on the anti-Semites but on the Jews. Wasserstein refutes the common misconception that they were unaware of the gathering forces of their enemies. He demonstrates that there was a growing and widespread recognition among Jews that they stood on the edge of an abyss. <br><br><i>On the Eve </i>recaptures the agonizing sorrows and the effervescent cultural glories of this last phase in the history of the European Jews. It explores their hopes, anxieties, and ambitions, their family ties, social relations, and intellectual creativity&#x2014;everything that made life meaningful and bearable for them. <br><br>Wasserstein introduces a diverse array of characters: holy men and hucksters, beggars and bankers, politicians and poets, housewives and harlots, and, in an especially poignant chapter, children without a future. The geographical range also is vast: from Vilna (the &#x201c;Jerusalem of the North&#x201d;) to Amsterdam, Vienna, Warsaw, and Paris, from the Judeo-Espagnol-speaking stevedores of Salonica to the Yiddish-language collective farms of Soviet Ukraine and Crimea. <br><br>Wasserstein&#x2019;s aim is to &#x201c;breathe life into dry bones.&#x201d; Based on comprehensive research, rendered with compassion and empathy, and brought alive by telling anecdotes and dry wit, <i>On the Eve </i>offers a vivid and enlightening picture of the European Jews in their final hour.</p><p><b>Bernard Wasserstein</b> is Ulrich and Harriet Meyer Professor of Modern European Jewish History at the University of Chicago.

They were distributed among four zones, each with a different history, divergent conditions of life, and, on the face of things, varying prospects for the future. In the democracies of western Europe, Jews had been emancipated for several generations and enjoyed a civic equality that, in spite of the rising tide of anti-Semitism, protected them, for the time being, against any threat to their security. By contrast, in Germany and those parts of central Europe that had already been absorbed into the Third Reich, Jews were in the process of being stripped of citizenship, subjected to discriminatory laws, driven out of the professions, and deprived of the bulk of their possessions, and were under intense pressure to emigrate. In a third zone, comprising all the states of east-central Europe, anti-Semitism, often drawing on deep popular roots, formed a significant element in political discourse and in most countries had been integrated into public policy in the shape of explicitly or implicitly anti-Jewish laws. Finally, in the Soviet Union, where the Jews had been emancipated in 1917, later than anywhere else in Europe (save only Romania), they enjoyed dramatic upward social mobility in the interwar period. But collective Jewish life, whether religious, political, or cultural, was, like other aspects of existence under Stalin, subject to severe restrictions.<br> <br>In German, the word Judentum means simultaneously &#x201c;Judaism&#x201d; and &#x201c;Jewry.&#x201d; But in the heart of the European Jew since the Enlightenment a schism had arisen between the conceptions of Judaism as a religion and as a Volksgemeinde, a community based on common ethnicity. In France, since their emancipation during the revolution, many Jews had come to regard it as a cardinal principle that Jewishness was a purely religious category and that in every respect they were as French as other Frenchmen. In Germany, where emancipation had come later and where social relations between Jews and gentiles, even in the liberal Weimar period between 1918 and 1933, were more fragile, matters were slightly different. There, writes George Mosse, a scion of the German-Jewish elite, &#x201c;there was no either/or&#x2014;either German or Jew.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Jewishness was not merely a religion but was primarily linked to pride of family, from which it could not be divorced.&#x201d;1 In eastern Europe, where boundaries of state and nation rarely ran together, and where most Jews still spoke Yiddish, lived in dense concentrations, and held more closely to their own cultural patterns, Jewishness tended to be seen by Jews themselves as well as by their neighbors as primarily an ethnic category. This was true also in the USSR, where &#x201c;Jewish&#x201d; was a legally recognized national distinction.<br> Like God in France<p></p> <br>The democratic zone of interwar Europe was the most comfortable for Jews. But it held the smallest share of the continent&#x2019;s Jewish population, under a million, or less than 10 percent of the total.<br> <br>In western Europe, however, the security that Jews enjoyed was no longer quite so automatic or unquestioned as in the past. True, a Jew had been elected prime minister of France in 1936. But the socialist L�on Blum&#x2019;s victory as head of the left-wing Popular Front was regarded as a mixed blessing by many French Jews. The government&#x2019;s enemies on the right focused on Blum&#x2019;s Jewishness and used it, to some effect, as a propaganda bludgeon against the left. Even in the Netherlands, with its long history of Christian-Jewish amity, stretching back to the friendly reception of &#x201c;New Christians&#x201d; (Marranos) from the Iberian peninsula in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, a certain unease entered into the relationship in the 1930s following the arrival of large numbers of refugees from Nazi Germany.<br> <br>The phrase heureux comme un juif en France (&#x201c;happy like a Jew in France&#x201d;) had come to have the proverbial meaning of very happy. But over the previous generation it had often been tinged with irony. At the turn of the century, the Dreyfus Affair had suggested that there were limits to the recognition of Jews as French. Since 1919, with the return by Germany of Alsace and Lorraine to France, French Jews, a majority of whom traced their origins to the two regained provinces, might again feel content to be fully part of the national patrimony. But their enemies now turned the phrase against them, suggesting that the Jews were too happy in France, in other words that they were doing too well, at the expense of others.<br> Mendelssohn&#x2019;s Heirs<p></p> <br>In its origin, the phrase was a play on the German/Yiddish leben wie Gott in Frankreich, which meant to live very well. Under the Weimar Republic in Germany, Jews looked forward to the consolidation of more than a century of progress toward legal equality and social acceptance in a country and culture in which they felt no less at home than French Jews did in France.<br> <br>That sense of ease was manifested all over Germany in September 1929, when Jews and Christians alike celebrated the two hundredth anniversary of the birth of Moses Mendelssohn, father of the Jewish enlightenment and progenitor of a dynasty of bankers, musicians, and scholars who remained a significant force in the culture, economy, and politics of the country. The minister of the interior, Carl Severing, and the leading Liberal rabbi in Berlin, Leo Baeck, were among those who delivered encomia to mark the occasion. At a Sunday matin�e concert in Mendelssohn&#x2019;s birthplace, Dessau, works by Bach and Beethoven were performed in his honor. A representative of the city of Berlin laid a wreath at the philosopher&#x2019;s grave in memory of a &#x201c;great fellow-citizen.&#x201d; His descendants, all now Christians, reserved an entire luxury hotel for three days for a gathering of the clan. The series of events was a symbolic high point of the modern German-Jewish symbiosis.2</p><h2>Fog Island</h2><p>"<p><b>Top 10 Children&#x2019;s Book 2013 &#x2013; New York Times Book Review</b></p> <p><b>A <i>Publishers Weekly</i> Best Children&#x2019;s Book of 2013</b></p><p><b>A <i>New York Times</i> Best Illustrated Children&#x2019;s Book of 2013</b></p><p><b>"Tomi Ungerer has created another masterpiece." &#x2013; Eric Carle</b></p><p>In this imaginative tale from master storyteller Tomi Ungerer, two young siblings find themselves cast away on mysterious Fog Island.

The spare text captures the lilt of country folk, as well as their superstitions. Ungerer creates an eerie atmosphere by using a palette of predominantly somber hues of gray, black, brown, and blue. The art is dramatic and powerful; the cover spread of fog-enshrouded children glows with breathtaking beauty. After their father builds a small curragh for his son and daughter, he warms them never to go to Fog Island, a "doomed and evil place," but one day they find themselves lost in a fog and currents carry them to there. Once they land, the curious youngsters climb a set of slippery stairs with creepy faces peering at them and skeletonlike vines intertwined among the rocks. But the person who answers the door at the top is the rather lonely and congenial Fog Man. He shows them how he makes fog, serves them a strange fish stew, and tucks them into bed. When they awake the next morning, they find themselves lying among ruins with no one in sight, but with steaming bowls of stew by their side. Literal-minded readers might wonder why the Fog Man's lair appears to be underwater, when the children walked so far up the steps to find it. And the subsequent storm and rescue at sea seems tacked on. Nevertheless, this intriguing story will ignite discussion on the central question-was the Fog Man real, or a dream?-Caroline Ward, The Ferguson Library, Stamford, CT&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Viertel (American Skin, 1983, etc.), son of a European theater director and of Sasha Viertel, scenarist of six movies for her buddy Greta Garbo, attended his mother's Hollywood Sunday soirees for Thomas Mann and other refugee literati, and at 15 met John Huston. Viertel finished his first novel at 18, worked on screenplays, and married Budd Schulberg's ex-wife, Jigee. After a second unsuccessful novel, and years as a Marine officer in European Intelligence in WW II, he wrote a Broadway play with Irwin Shaw, which failed, and then met his idol, Hemingway, while skiing in Idaho. Friendships with Hemingway and Huston could be rocky. When Huston hired Viertel to co-write We Were Strangers, a Havana- based melodrama, Hemingway accepted Huston and Viertel as guests at his Cuban home and gave them testy advice about their picture. Viertel's roman ... clef White Hunter, Black Heart tells of hazarding the African jungle with Huston to film The African Queen. Viertel worked on many Hemingway scripts and followed the bulls with ``Papa'' for many years. Endless celebrities became deep friends: his agent Irving ``Swifty'' Lazar, Orson Welles, Ava Gardner, Robert Capa, Slim Hayward, Humphrey Bogart, Darryl Zanuck, Anatol Litvak, and a dozen more, who appear here in the flesh and full of obsessions. Viertel abandoned Jigee while she was pregnant, for a model who later abandoned him for Aly Khan. A marriage to Deborah Kerr has lasted about three decades. Not stylish, but honest. Viertel's most memorable book, and a likely big winner. (Forty b&amp;w photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>While the two famous H's named in the subtitle get the lion's share of the coverage, screenwriter and novelist Viertel ( The African Queen ; White Hunter, Black Heart ) talks mostly about himself while spilling the dope on fellow writers (Irwin Shaw), a slew of movie big shots (Ava Gardner, Humphrey Bogart), and the two leading bullfighters of the time. Though many popular celebrities appear, it's hard to find anyone likable. Almost all are either drunks, adulterers, or, in most cases, both. At the top of the Hollywood dung heap is Huston. Hemingway's reputation is well known, but next to Huston he comes off like a saint. Viertel neither praises nor buries his subjects, but his adoption of many of their passions--from fox hunting and bullfighting to extramarital gymnastics--is evidence of their influence upon him. Clearly, Viertel's admiration of his subjects has sugarcoated his memories too thoroughly to make them truly reliable.

Future ju rors become acquainted with the process itself, but even more importantly, they must confront the issues and assume the awesome responsi bility that accompanies jury decisions.

Not for the casual reader, the book takes concentration and critical thinking. For each case, there are possible verdicts, questions, analyses, and instructions. Finally, the verdict is stated and explained. Some of the cases are lengthy, but the exchanges between the attor neys, defendants, and witnesses are often live ly. It's difficult to capture the nuances of real courtroom interaction in print, but even those who are not ``People's Court'' fans will find this a good reflection of the process as they sit in the jury box.

Pil�tre de Rozier, the first man to ascend in a fire balloon, also planned to be the first to fly the Channel from France to England. To this end he constructed a new kind of aerostat, with a hydrogen balloon on top, to give greater lift, and a fire balloon beneath, to give better control. He put these two things together, and on the 15th of June 1785, when the winds seemed favourable, he made his ascent from the Pas-de-Calais. The brave new contraption rose swiftly, but before it had even reached the coastline, flame appeared at the top of&nbsp;the hydrogen balloon, and the whole, hopeful aerostat, now looking to one observer like a heavenly gas lamp, fell to earth, killing both pilot and co-pilot.<br> &nbsp;<br> You put together two people who have not been put together before; and sometimes the world is changed, sometimes not. They may crash and burn, or burn and crash. But sometimes, something new is made, and then the world is changed. Together, in that first exaltation, that first roaring sense of uplift, they are greater than their two separate selves. Together, they see further, and they see more clearly.<br> &nbsp;<br> Of course, love may not be evenly matched; perhaps it rarely is. To put it another way: how did those besieged Parisians of 1870-71 get replies to their letters? You can fly a balloon out from the Place St.-Pierre and assume it will land somewhere useful; but you can hardly expect the winds, however patriotic, to blow it back to Montmartre on a return flight. Various stratagems were proposed: for example, placing the return correspondence in large metal globes and floating them downstream into the city, there to be caught in nets. Pigeon post was a more obvious idea, and a Batignolles pigeon fancier put his dovecote at the authorities&#x2019; disposal: a basket of birds might be flown out with each siege balloon, and return bearing letters. But compare the freight capacity of a balloon and a pigeon, and imagine the weight of disappointment. According to Nadar, the solution came from an engineer who worked in sugar manufacture. Letters intended for Paris were to be written in a clear hand, on one side of the paper, with the recipient&#x2019;s address at the top. Then, at the collecting station, hundreds of them would be laid side by side on a large screen and photographed. The image would be micrographically reduced, flown into Paris by carrier pigeon, and enlarged back to readable size. The revived letters were then put into envelopes and delivered to their addressees. It was better than nothing; indeed, it was a technical triumph. But imagine a pair of lovers, one able to write privately and at length on both sides of the page, and hide the tenderest words in an envelope; the other constrained by brevity and the knowledge that private feelings might be publicly inspected by photographers and postmen. Although&#x2014;isn&#x2019;t that how love sometimes feels, and works?<br> &nbsp;<br> Sarah Bernhardt was photographed by Nadar&#x2014;first the father, later the son&#x2014;throughout her life. Her first session took place when she was about twenty, at the time F�lix Tournachon was also involved in another tumultuous, if briefer, career: that of <i>The Giant</i>. Sarah is not yet Divine&#x2014;she is unknown, aspiring; yet the portraits already show her a star. <br> &nbsp;<br> She is simply posed, wrapped in a velvet cloak, or an enveloping shawl. Her shoulders are bare; she wears no jewellery except a small pair of cameo earrings; her hair is virtually undressed. So is she: there is more than a hint that she wears little beneath that cloak, that shawl. Her expression is withholding, and thus alluring. She is, of course, very beautiful, perhaps more so to the modern eye than at the time. She seems to embody truthfulness, theatricality and mystery&#x2014;and make those abstractions compatible. Nadar also took a nude photograph which some claim is of her. It shows a woman, naked to the waist, peek-a-booing with one eye from behind a spread fan. Whatever the case, the portraits of Sarah cloaked and shawled are decidedly more erotic.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Scarcely five feet tall, she was not considered the right size for an actress; also, too pale and too thin. She seemed impulsive and natural in both life and art; she broke theatrical rules, often turning upstage to deliver a speech. She slept with all her leading men. She loved fame and self-publicity&#x2014;or, as Henry James silkily put it, she was &#x201c;a figure so admirably suited for conspicuity.&#x201d; One critic compared her successively to a Russian princess, a Byzantine empress and a Muscat begum, before concluding: &#x201c;Above all, she is as Slav as one can be. She is much more Slav than all the Slavs I have ever met.&#x201d; In her early twenties she had an illegitimate son, whom she took everywhere with her, heedless of disapproval. She was Jewish in a largely anti-Semitic France, while in Catholic Montreal they stoned her carriage. She was brave and doughty.<br><br>Naturally, she had enemies. Her success, her sex, her racial origin and her bohemian extravagance reminded the puritanical why actors used to be buried in unhallowed ground. And over the decades her acting style, once so original, inevitably dated, since naturalness onstage is just as much an artifice as naturalism in the novel. If the magic always worked for some&#x2014;Ellen Terry called her &#x201c;transparent as an azalea&#x201d; and compared her stage presence to &#x201c;smoke from a burning paper&#x201d;&#x2014;others were less kind. Turgenev, though a Francophile and himself a dramatist, found her &#x201c;false, cold, affected,&#x201d; and condemned her &#x201c;repulsive Parisian chic.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Fred Burnaby was often described as bohemian. His official biographer wrote that he lived &#x201c;entirely aloof, absolutely regardless of conventionalities.&#x201d; And he had known the exoticism which Bernhardt merely appropriated. A traveller might bring reports back to Paris from afar; a playwright would pillage them for themes and effects; then a designer and costumier would perfect the illusion around her. Burnaby had been that traveller: he had gone deep into Russia, across Asia Minor and the Middle East, up the Nile. He had crossed Fashoda country, where both sexes went naked and dyed their hair bright yellow. Stories that adhered to him often featured Circassian girls, gypsy dancers and pretty Kirghiz widows.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>He claimed descent from Edward I, the king known as Longshanks, and displayed virtues of courage and truth-speaking which the English imagine unique to themselves. Yet there was something unsettling about him. His father was said to be &#x201c;melancholy as the padge-owl that hooted in his park,&#x201d; and Fred, though vigorous and extrovert, inherited this trait. He was enormously strong, yet frequently ill, tormented by liver and stomach pains; &#x201c;gastric catarrh&#x201d; once drove him to a foreign spa. And though &#x201c;very popular in London and Paris,&#x201d; and a member of the Prince of Wales&#x2019;s circle, he was described by the Dictionary of National Biography as living &#x201c;much alone.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>The conventional accept and are frequently charmed by a certain unconventionality; Burnaby seems to have exceeded that limit. One of his devoted friends called him &#x201c;the most slovenly rascal that ever lived,&#x201d; who sat &#x201c;like a sack of corn on a horse.&#x201d; He was held to be foreign-looking, with &#x201c;oriental features&#x201d; and a Mephistophelean smile. The DNB called his looks &#x201c;Jewish and Italian,&#x201d; noting that his &#x201c;unEnglish&#x201d; appearance &#x201c;led him to resist attempts to procure portraits of him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We live on the flat, on the level, and yet&#x2014;and so&#x2014; we aspire. Groundlings, we can sometimes reach as far as the gods. Some soar with art, others with religion; most with love. But when we soar, we can also crash. There are few soft landings. We may find ourselves bouncing across the ground with leg-fracturing force, dragged towards some foreign railway line. Every love story is a potential grief story. If not at first, then later. If not for one, then for the other. Sometimes, for both.<br> &nbsp;<br> So why do we constantly aspire to love? Because love is the meeting point of truth and magic. Truth, as in photography; magic, as in ballooning.</p></p><h2>Columbo: The Helter Skelter Murders</h2><p>When the wife of a wealthy store owner and her lover are murdered, Columbo fears that another round of Manson murders is beginning, and despite findings that have already implicated a suspect, the detective knows the worst is yet to come</p><p>ONE<br>August 9, 1994<br>Khoury's<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The name was on his store on Rodeo Drive, in gleaming stainless-steel block letters--<br>It was on his license plate--khoury. It was on labels securely affixed to ten thousand items of merchandise--imported by khoury. It was the center of the oval logo fired on the bottom of every plate, saucer, and cup of his line of chinaware--khoury &amp; co. It was engraved on the bottoms of gold and silver cigarette lighters, compacts, pocket flasks, and so on, and on the backs of watches--A khoury design. It was on the labels sewn into his line of lingerie--the khoury collection. His motion-picture production company was Khoury &amp; Associates.<br>Discriminating taste was his life: his life's work, his passion, his chief source of satisfaction. His very name was a synonym for chic. No, for more than that, for elegance.<br>The name inspired confidence in the people who bought at Khoury's. Since 1946, when his father established the store, the name had connoted urbane and pricey. As they said around down, you couldn't buy tchotchkes at Khoury's. Yussef <i>p�re</i> and now Yussef <i>fils</i>, father and son, traveled the world to find merchandise that would honor the name and appeal to their client�le. They had intuitive eyes for quality. Anything bought at Khoury's was something exquisite, superior for its kind, whatever it was: something simple or something elaborate. A gift might not be what the recipient wanted or had any use for, but the name Khoury's on the box usually made up the deficiency.<br>The hour was six-thirty, and on an August evening the sun was still high and brilliant. Yussef Khoury could have driven into the store parking lot from the street behind, but he enjoyed driving past, looking at the palm-shaded building and at the stream of customers going in and coming out. His father had had the brick building painted white. The son had had the facade lightly sandblasted, knocking off about half the paint and leaving a dulled white and red surface that was a Beverly Hills landmark. No colored lights shone on the stainless-steel letters that spelled his name. No floodlights shone on the front of the store in the evening. People knew where Khoury's was. They would find it.<br>His car was a 1954 gull-wing silver Mercedes sports sedan, a classic automobile now worth many times what it had sold for when it was new. Its most distinguishing feature was the doors. Hinged at the center of the roof, they swung up. He drove around the corner and into the parking lot. A uniformed guard and a plainclothesman were always on duty in the lot, and both of them saluted as Khoury drove in. He put the car in the space with his name on it.<br>"Good evening, Mr. Khoury," said the plainclothesman, as Khoury popped the gull-wing open. "Did you have a good workout?"<br>"Good evening, Mike. I sure did. With a swim. Best exercise in the world, a swim. Good for the body, good for the mind."<br>Fifty-four years old, Yussef Khoury was a compact, muscular man of less than average height, with an olive complexion and small dark eyes. He was bald. In past years he had sometimes worn a toupee but hadn't done that for several years. He was dressed as was appropriate for Yussef Khoury--that is, to perfection, in a dark-blue suit tailored to fit him exactly, a monogrammed white shirt, a necktie in the regimental stripe of the Third Royal Welch Fusiliers, and black Gucci loafers. He wore a handsome star sapphire ring and a Khoury wristwatch.<br>Brushed-aluminum plaques affixed to the rear wall of the building marked two reserved parking places: his own and his wife's. Arlene Khoury's Silver Cloud was not there; and, since she allowed no one else to drive it, he could assume she had left for the day.<br>He entered the store through the rear entrance, which opened directly onto the main merchandising floor, the ground floor. He glanced around and, with his experience, saw that business was brisk. People were buying, not just looking.<br>The main floor had departments for jewelry, crystal, china, silver, prints, paintings, small sculpture, and bric-a-brac. Some articles were antiques, but most were of contemporary craftsmanship. Many were museum-quality reproductions. Although the store did not sell clothing, occasionally it would offer a Japanese kimono, a Chinese robe, or something of the like. A popular item was the authentic English "brolly," imported from London: an innovation introduced by Khoury <i>fils</i> in 1975, after his father died and could no longer pronounce it trivial. A new department, introduced only in 1987, sold a line a small appliances: digital clocks, telephones and digital telephone-answering machines, coffee makers, multiband radios, and tiny portable television sets--all of them outstanding examples of dramatic yet functional modern design, all of them bearing the Khoury name.<br>As he walked through the store, sales clerks glanced away from their customers for an instant to nod a greeting. Customers left the counters for a moment to speak to him. A few came to shake his hand and exchange pleasantries.<br>The store had no windows, so the light inside never varied. It had been carefully designed to display merchandise under the best possible tones--cooler light in the appliances section, warmer in the jewelry section, and so on. No music played. That, in Khoury's judgment, distracted customers from what they were here for: to see and buy. On the other hand, they could step into the Khoury Caf� and enjoy complimentary coffee or tea while they waited for someone or pondered a purchase. For those who wanted to smoke, there was a smoking lounge with quiet, concealed fans that exhausted the stench and did not allow it to escape into the store.<br>"Hi, Joe!"<br>Yussef Khoury suggested his friends call him Joe Damon Christopher strode across the carpet with outstretched hand. His new film, <i>Iron Man</i>, was playing to great reviews and big box office; and his equity in it was going to earn him five or six million dollars, minimum. He was of course a big fellow, like the heroes he played, blond and ruddy faced, with a cleft chin and sensual blue eyes.<br>Christopher pumped Khoury's hand, then tapped the box he was carrying. "From upstairs," he said with a wide, suggestive grin. "Damned good thing it comes from Khoury's, or she'd never even <i>consider</i> wearing it."<br>He had been to the second-floor lingerie shop. His box was wrapped in the distinctive Khoury aluminum-colored paper and tied with the Khoury ribbon: rich metallic blue. Wherever a package like that went, people immediately recognized it as something from Khoury's.<br>"I'm glad you found something you like," said Khoury, smiling warmly. "I wish you good luck with it."<br>"Oh, it will do the trick," said Christopher. "A little argument. This will do the trick."<br>Christopher slapped Khoury's arm and walked on. He would never have come into the store, probably, if not for the lingerie shop opened in 1975; and he was probably correct in guessing that his wife--if in fact the gift was for his wife--would be far more likely to wear the boldly revealing item in that box because it came from Khoury's. It was a fact that women would wear lingerie from Khoury's that they might have considered cheap and demeaning if it had come from anywhere else.<br>Khoury had wanted to do the lingerie collection for years before his father died. The old man would never allow it, arguing that it would surely offend some of their lady customers. The son understood otherwise. He had given the second floor over to a group of boutiques, some of them operated by concessionaries--for example, the perfume and cosmetics boutique and the chocolate shop. Placed discreetly out of the sight of those who did not want to shop for scanty undies there, the Khoury Collection boutique was a busy profit center.<br>Khoury could have taken an elevator up, but he preferred to climb the broad stairway to the second floor, then a narrower stairway to the third.<br>The third floor was the office floor, where he and his wife, Arlene, occupied executive officers: has a suite, hers a simpler office. All the rest of the administrative functions required for a major retail operation were on the third floor also.<br>As he walked along the long corridor between the stairs and his suite, the door to his wife's office opened. Her secretary--a dark-haired, attractive woman of forty-six--came out. She was intent on using her keys to lock the office and did not notice him until he was upon her.<br>"Oh--Hello, Joe," she said, a bit startled.<br>"Hello, Puss," he said. Her name was Cathy Murphy, but she liked the nickname Puss, so that's what he called her. "How's everything?"<br>She smiled. "It's a little difficult, you know."<br>"I know," he said. "Hang in there. We'll do something about it."<br>He had hired her to work in his own office, as a second secretary. His wife hadn't liked it, hadn't liked an attractive woman with an intriguing past working for him. Arlene had first demanded he send her back to the sales floor, where she had worked before, them had agreed to her remaining on the third floor, provided she would be <i>her</i> secretary, not one of his. Arlene didn't like her, just the same, and seemed to take every chance she could find to humiliate her. It was a situation that would have to be remedied, sooner or later, one way or another.<br>Khoury knew all about Cathy Murphy. She had spent several years of her life in prison. In fact, she had learned her secretarial skills in the women's reformatory at Fontera. Twenty-five years ago, she had been one of the Manson girls, though not one of those involved in the Tate-LaBianca murders. She had gone to prison for something else entirely. Charlie Manson had bestowed a nickname on her, as he did on most of the girls who clung to him as his "Family": Puss Dogood.<br>She had dark-brown hair which she still wore long and straight, a style she had adopted when she was a...well, a hippie: the word that came to Joe Khoury's mind. She was an attractive woman with regular features and a good figure. She wore no makeup, ever. At work she dressed modestly in blouses and skirts, but he had encountered her in a shopping mall one evening and learned that off duty she dressed like an earth child. He also knew that from time to time she slipped out to smoke a cigarette on the loading dock.<br>"We'll straighten it out, Puss," he said. "Just hang in and be as patient as you can."<br>"Thank you, Joe. Your assurance is what makes it possible. Otherwise--"<br>He held up a hand, stopping her.<br>"No. Don't think of quitting, Puss. Don't worry, we'll straighten things out."<br>Cathy Murphy--Puss Dogood--nodded and walked toward the stairs. She stopped and turned. "Joe..." She grinned. "If you want to help me get even with her again sometime, just say the word."<br>Khoury smiled but said nothing and went on into his office.<br>His secretary was not at her desk in outer office. She had gone home apparently. But Kimberly was waiting for him. She was sitting on the leather-upholstered couch, smoking a cigarette and reading <i>Vanity Fair</i>.<br>The name she used was Kimberly Dana. She was twenty-nine years old, a tall, slender, athletic young woman, strikingly beautiful: a blonde with near-perfect facial features--accented nevertheless with makeup so skillfully applied that even Khoury could not always be entirely sure it was there. She was an archetypal California beach girl, so much so that she played women's beach volleyball on television and had a small following of fans.<br>"You know, if you didn't smoke those damned cigarettes you would be utterly perfect," he said to her.<br>She crushed the cigarette in the ashtray on the table in front of the couch and pulled a breath spray from her handbag. "Only the second one today," she said. "I got bored waiting for you."<br>"Was Arlene still here when you came in?" he asked.<br>"No, dear. I waited until the Silver Cloud was out of the parking lot before I came upstairs. Eleanor was gone. The flower child was still here, though."<br>"Yes. I saw her as I came in. It's hard to believe the double life she leads--working here until six-thirty as the loyal, honest secretary, then going out into the mountains and spending the night with her...With whatever you call it. Her commune."<br>"Her tribe," said Kimberly.<br>"Well, let's not knock it. Her tribe is going to be very useful to us."<br>"What we need is in the car. Locked in the trunk."<br>"No everything," said Yussef.<br>He went to a Chinese-style lacquered black cabinet and opened it, exposing a large safe. He worked the combination and swung back the heavy steel door. From inside the safe he withdrew two oval steel batons about seven inches long. They were hollow and perforated with a dozen or so half-inch holes that fit fingertips and afforded a secure grip. Hinged at one end, the two halves of the batons could swing apart.<br>He handed one to Kimberly. Using both hands, she seized the baton at the end opposite the hinge and pulled the two halves apart. The two halves were in face the halves of a steel sheath for a six-inch blade. It was a singularly deadly weapon, called a Bali-Song. With the handles closed, the Bali-Song was a heavy bludgeon. With them fully open, that is, swung back against each other, it was a conventional knife. With the handles swung out halfway, to a 90� angle with the blade, an attacker could grip a Bali-Song with both hands and thrust forward with the force of two arms.<br>It was maybe the most expensive knife in the world. Yussef had never considered offering them for sale in the store, but he had bought half a dozen of them because he admired the design, and he had given several to friends. He had explained to Kimberly when he first showed her a Bali-Song that the Philippines, where they originated, had outlawed them; it was a crime to own one there.<br>She had smiled and commented, "Well, Joe, you always have the best."<br>"They will lend a certain elegance to a dirty job," he had said.<br>She dropped both of them into her handbag before they left the office.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright �1994 by MCA Publishing Rights, a Division of MCA, Inc.Peter Falk meets Charles Manson, right? Well, not exactly: The rumpled detective isn't really played by the TV actor, though he sure looks and sounds like him, and he meets Manson only once, briefly--not counting the time back in 1969 when (we're told) he was part of the original Manson family investigation. Unlike Lt. Columbo's hardcover debut (Columbo: The Grassy Knoll, 1993), this cheatingly titled case doesn't reopen a real-life crime and doesn't involve the Manson family except in the most peripheral sense: as a cover for a very ordinary copycat murder timed for the silver anniversary of Sharon Tate's death. Taking advantage of the fact that Cathy Murphy--baptized Puss Dogood when she threw in with Manson 25 years ago--is his hated wife Arlene's secretary, LA boutique king Yussef Khoury plots with his own secretary/lover Kimberly Dana to kill Arlene and her paramour and pin the blame on poor Puss. Luckily for the Manson class of '69, the inimitable Columbo is on the scene, imperturbably writing out his grocery list, trying once again to qualify with his own .38, mumbling about taking scuba lessons, and incidentally nailing the conspirators while providing his faithful TV audience whatever thrills they can get from cheering ``hotter, hotter'' (his inquiries about a Harry Winston choker supposedly stolen from Arlene's nightstand) and ``colder, colder'' (an interminable subplot involving Khoury's film production company) en route to a windup without a single new surprise and an epilogue cribbed from Dragnet.

So she spends her days playing with a kite made from paper and sticks.<br> When the Emperor is captured and imprisoned in a high tower, though, it is Djeow Seow who patiently weaves a long, strong rope of her own hair, attaches it to the tail of her kite, and cleverly flies up to her father in hopes of rescuing him.<br> Ed Young's brilliant full-color illustrations, which are based on an intricate traditional Oriental papercut technique, grace this tale by renowned storyteller Jane Yolen. Told in an easy-to-read yet sensitive and poetic style, it evokes the long-ago and far-away flavor of ancient China. At the heart of the story are the timeless qualities of love and loyalty.<br> This newly designed edition of the classic <i>The Emperor and the Kite</i> joins the beauty of language and art so wondrously that readers of all ages will be enchanted.</p><p>Born and raised in New York City, Jane Yolen now lives in Hatfield, Massachusetts. She attended Smith College and received her master's degree in education from the University of Massachusetts. The distinguished author of more than 170 books, Jane Yolen is a person of many talents. When she is not writing, Yolen composes songs, is a professional storyteller on the stage, and is the busy wife of a university professor, the mother of three grown children, and a grandmother.<p>Active in several organizations, Yolen has been on the Board of Directors of the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators, was president of the Science Fiction Writers of America from 1986 to 1988, is on the editorial board of several magazines, and was a founding member of the Western New England Storytellers Guild, the Western Massachusetts Illustrators Guild, and the Bay State Writers Guild. For twenty years, she ran a monthly writer's workshop for new children's book authors. In 1980, when Yolen was awarded an honorary Doctor of Law degree by Our Lady of the Elms College in Chicopee, Massachusetts, the citation recognized that "throughout her writing career she has remained true to her primary source of inspiration--folk culture." Folklore is the "perfect second skin," writes Yolen. "From under its hide, we can see all the shimmering, shadowy uncertainties of the world." Folklore, she believes, is the universal human language, a language that children instinctively feel in their hearts.</p><p>All of Yolen's stories and poems are somehow rooted in her sense of family and self. <b>The Emperor and the Kite</b>, which was a Caldecott Honor Book in 1983 for its intricate papercut illustrations by Ed Young, was based on Yolen's relationship with her late father, who was an international kite-flying champion. <b>Owl Moon</b>, winner of the 1988 Caldecott Medal for John Schoenherr's exquisite watercolors, was inspired by her husband's interest in birding.</p><p>Yolen's graceful rhythms and outrageous rhymes have been gathered in numerous collections. She has earned many awards over the years: the Regina Medal, the Kerlan Award, the World Fantasy Award, the Society of Children's Book Writers Award, the Mythopoetic Society's Aslan Award, the Christopher Medal, the Boy's Club Jr. Book Award, the Garden State Children's Book Award, the Daedalus Award, a number of Parents' Choice Magazine Awards, and many more. Her books and stories have been translated into Japanese, French, Spanish, Chinese, German, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Afrikaans, !Xhosa, Portuguese, and Braille.</p><p>With a versatility that has led her to be called "America's Hans Christian Andersen," Yolen, the child of two writers, is a gifted and natural storyteller. Perhaps the best explanation for her outstanding accomplishments comes from Jane Yolen herself: "I don't care whether the story is real or fantastical. I tell the story that needs to be told."</p><p>copyright 2000 by Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.

The lyrics to well over 100 songs are presented, dating from the first track on his 1973 debut, <i>Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.</i> (that would be "Blinded by the Light") through the last selection on 1995's <i>The Ghost of Tom Joad</i> ("My Best Was Never Good Enough"). The lyrics are broken up by photos (a ponytailed youth practices his guitar on a bed in his parents' apartment, the Boss buys a burger, Springsteen mugs while on a desert motorcycle outing). Original lyric sheets provide some insight into the Jersey boy's creative methodology. Most interesting, however, are the chapters Springsteen penned for the book. Broken down by album, they provide abbreviated accounts of his creative development, and some of the writing is quite telling. (Of his commercial smash <i>Born in the U.S.A.</i>, he professes ambivalence: "It forced me to question the way I presented my music and made me think harder about what I was doing.") Passionate fans of the man will find this heavy-duty songbook, journal, and photo album rewarding, and it certainly whets the appetite for a more thorough memoir. <i>--Steven Stolder</i><p>&#x201c;The Boss&#x201d; hit the music industry with the release of his first album Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J., in 1973. The Wild, the Innocent, and The E Street Shuffle quickly followed this release. The albums received critical claim with comparisons to Bob Dylan, but did not sell well with the fans. Bruce Springsteen&#x2019;s career had begun.</p><p>Springsteen was born in Freehold, New Jersey, on September 23, 1949. He grew up in a &#x201c;normal middle class family&#x201d; and first started playing around with the guitar in High School. After graduating from High School he moved to New York to try and break into the Folk Music scene. After getting nowhere on this front he returned to, be it reluctantly, to Asbury Park, N.J. and hooked up with a number of bands. With brief stints with such bands as Rogues and Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom, Springsteen found himself a place with the E-Street Band, and with them he remained until 1989. Though, this wouldn&#x2019;t be the last time they would play together.</p><p>The 1973 albums marked the beginning of Springsteen&#x2019;s career and since then, &#x201c;The Boss&#x201d; has sold tens of millions of albums and won over legions of loyal fans worldwide in his 30 plus years as a &#x201c;rock and roll legend&#x201d;. His break came after a tour with the band Chicago. Springsteen captivated the audiences in these live shows, and seeing an opportunity, the singer-songwriter came up with what is called his breakthrough effort Born to Run in 1974. The title song &#x201c;Thunder Road&#x201d;&#x2019;s continuous playing on the radio brought the album to the top five. The album received an abundant of praise leading Springsteen to be dubbed the &#x201c;Savior of Rock &amp; Roll&#x201d;. Magazine&#x2019;s and Newspaper&#x2019;s were swarming to get him to appear in their publications.</p><p>After spending some time resolving management issues, the 1978 album Darkness on the Edge of Town was released. Marking the first of Springsteen&#x2019;s darker albums. Following this the album The River, in 1980 quickly went platinum in the United States and established Springsteen as an international star. Next was the release of his second darker album 1982&#x2019;s Nebraska. This album, an artistic despairing acoustic style recording, was recorded live in his New Jersey home and wasn&#x2019;t followed by a tour.</p><p>Switching gears again, &#x201c;The Boss&#x2019;s&#x201d; most famous release Born in the U.S.A came out in 1984. This pop style arena rock album sold 20 million copies and was followed by a massive two year long world wide tour. The new working class image of Born in the U.S.A. made Springsteen an international superstar. &#x201c;The Boss&#x201d; was born!</p>1987&#x2019;s Tunnel of Love was released during a time when Springsteen was facing marital problems. He began singing of lost love, emotional turmoil, and other adult concerns. He set off after this for one more tour with the E-Street Band and then in 1989 they parted ways. Three years later he released two albums Human Touch and Lucky Town. The first, Human Touch, was more radio orientated while Lucky Town, the latter, is seen as a step forward for the Springsteen.

At least they will in David A. Carter's pop-up version of the popular play song. Preschoolers will join in with glee, singing, "If you're happy and you know it...," while they help the playful animal characters clap their hands, wag their tails, and wink their eyes. Children pull simple tabs to animate the brightly hued cut-paper cat, dog, skunk, chicken, owl, and mouse. On the last page, all six animals pop up to "shout hooray" in a dramatic display of Carter's paper engineering flair. Musical notation for the song appears on the back cover.<p> Carter has created many well-loved interactive picture books, including another pop-up nursery song, <i>Old MacDonald Had a Farm</i>, as well as <i>Alpha Bugs: A Pop-Up Alphabet</i> and <i>Easter Bugs: A Springtime Pop-Up</i>.

Youngsters can open a farmyard fence as a pig jumps out with its sound, "oink oink," showing through a die-cut opening in Old MacDonald Had a Farm. With the pull of a tab, the cat claps and rooster flaps in If You're Happy and You Know It. The final spreads in both books pop up, with all the animals spelling "E-I-E-I-O!" in one and all the animals shouting "HOORAY!" in the other. Music and lyrics appear on the back covers.

Reprint.</p><p>Margot Sunderland is a child psychotherapist with 20 years of working with children and families. She is the author of more than 20 books on child mental health, and her extensive research into the neuroscience of parent-child interactions led to this book.Promoting a research-backed view of the parents-in-charge approach to child rearing, Sunderland's guide is a smart, complete book that never overwhelms. Laid out like a school textbook, with clear organization, copious color photographs and plenty of boldfaced "Key Points," Sunderland's text is upbeat, accessible and encouraging. Advice is both common-sense and well-considered: "each time you help your child think and feel about what he is experiencing, and each time you find the right words for his intense feelings, you are probably helping the development of more sophisticated communication networks in your child's corpus callosum." Sunderland focuses on explaining how the child's underdeveloped brain motivates so-called behavior problems, including "tears and rage" caused when baby's "higher brain is not developed enough to moderate these powerful lower brain systems naturally." One of the most interesting elements of the book is its insight into how a given parenting style affects a child in the long-run, such as the idea that "being left to cry means a child learns that he is abandoned just at the time when he needs help" and can make him vulnerable to depression and anxiety disorders. Easy-to-use and entirely thorough-covering not just baby care, but mom and dad care too-this is an excellent resource for parents, caregivers and other policy makers.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This is a topic often missing in English, though in stark contrast to the numerous books on the shorter and less bloody Winter War. That conflict represented a gallant fight of a democratic &#x201c;David&#x201d; against a totalitarian &#x201c;Goliath&#x201d; that caught the imagination of the world. The story of Finland fighting alongside a &#x201c;Goliath&#x201d; of its own has not brought pride to that nation and was a period many Finns would rather forget.<br><br>The prologue of this book brings the reader up to speed by briefly examining the difficult history of Finland, from its separation from the Soviet Union in 1917 to its isolation after being bludgeoned in 1939&#x2013;40. It then examines both Finnish and German motives for forming a coalition against the USSR, and how&#x2014;as logical as a common enemy would seem&#x2014;the lack of true planning and preparation would doom the alliance. <br><br>This book posits that it was mind-boggling how the highly professional German General Staff allowed itself to accept the militarily unsound and shaky coalition that resulted. The war aims were not discussed or harmonized, there were no campaign plans with tasks and missions spelled out past the initial assault, no effective main effort established, inadequate force levels, and an unsound command structure with various headquarters. Practically every rule in the book was broken. The objective of linking up with the Finns in the Leningrad area was an important factor in Hitler opting for three main drives into the Soviet Union rather than an earlier OKH plan that called for only two.<br><br>After describing the operations during and after Barbarossa, this book describes how the Finnish theater became a blind ally for the Germans. Their strongest and best army was trapped both operationally and geographically in central and northern Finland, making virtually no contribution to the war effort. The Germans could not bring to bear enough forces to accomplish their objectives without substantial Finnish assistance, and that was not forthcoming.<br><br>The final chapters deal with the Soviet counteroffensive against the Finns in 1944. The Finns lost all their gains and quickly concluded a separate armistice. This left the German forces in Finland to simply vacate the territory, fighting between the Finns and Soviets alike as they tried to return to the main war. Jointly suffering 291,000 casualties, the only consolation was that the coalition had inflicted some 830,000 on the Soviets.<br><br>In this book, Henrik Lunde, a former US Special Operations colonel, and the renowned author of Hitler&#x2019;s Pre-emptive War: The Battle for Norway, 1940, once again fills a profound gap in our understanding of World War II.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Preface And Acknowledgments<br>Prologue<br><br>1.

Within less than two weeks, the offending fish killed four swimmers and badly injured another, setting off a wave of panic that kept visitors well out of the water and threatened the state's thriving tourist economy.<p> Officials were quick to react. President Woodrow Wilson, himself from New Jersey, sought and received $5,000 from Congress to eradicate the villain. Unsure of which species was to blame, commercial fishermen and state police alike destroyed every shark they encountered, while some conspiracy-minded journalists hinted that the attacks had somehow been triggered by German U-boats plying the waters off New Jersey.</p><p> Those strange events of 1916 are not much remembered today, except, perhaps, by fans of Peter Benchley's novel <i>Jaws</i>, whose origin lies in the attacks. Richard Fernicola revives the incident with this thoroughgoing investigation, which offers solid information on the natural history and behavior of the many shark species that populate the Atlantic, and which hazards educated guesses as to which kind of shark did the fatal mischief--and why. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>In July 1916, four people were killed in two weeks by a series of shark attacks, causing panic all along the coast. Perhaps best known as the inspiration for the Peter Benchley novel and Steve Spielberg film 'Jaws,' the story is set down here as the gripping record of what really happened.<br></p><h2>Frank Frazetta Book Two</h2><p>Twelve black and white studies and thirty two magnificent color plates in this book, Frank Frazzetta proves his pre eminence in the worlds of fantasy and science fiction art.</p><p></p><h2>The Ugly Chinaman and the Crisis of Chinese Culture</h2><p>This critique of the Chinese was banned in mainland China by Communist Party officials.

The head of MI6, M, assigns him to shadow the mysterious Dr. Julius Gorner, a power-crazed pharmaceutical magnate, whose wealth is exceeded only by his greed. Gorner has lately taken a disquieting interest in opiate derivatives, both legal and illegal, and this urgently bears looking into. <br><br>Bond finds a willing accomplice in the shape of a glamorous Parisian named Scarlett Papava.

He was born in 1593 and died at the age of 39 in 1633, before the clouds of civil war gathered, his family aristocratic and his upbringing privileged. He showed worldly ambition and seemed sure of high public office and a career at court, but then for a time &#39;lost himself in a humble way&#39;, devoting himself to the restoration of the church at Leighton Bromswold in Buckinghamshire and then to his parish of Bemerton, three miles from Salisbury, whose cathedral music he called &#39;my heaven on earth&#39;. When in the year of his death his friend Nicholas Ferrar, leader of the quasi-monastic community at Little Gidding, published Herbert&#39;s poems under the title The Temple, his fame was quickly established. Because he published no English poems during his lifetime, and dating most of them exactly is impossible, writing Herbert&#39;s biography is an unusual challenge. In this book John Drury sets the poetry in the whole context of the poet&#39;s life and times, so that the reader can understand the frame of mind and kind of society which produced it, and depth can be added to the narrative of Herbert&#39;s life. (T.S. Eliot: &#39;What we can confidently believe is that every poem in the book [The Temple] is in tune to the poet&#39;s experience.&#39;) His Herbert is not the saintly figure who has come down to us from John Aubrey, but a man torn for much of his life between worldly ambition and the spiritual life shown to us so clearly through his writings. The result is the most satisfying biography of this exceptional English poet yet written. JOHN DRURY is Chaplain and Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. He began as a biblical scholar, and while Dean of King&#39;s College, Cambridge, worked with Frank Kermode on the Gospels for The Literary Guide to the Bible, which sharpened his sense of the role of imagination in the formation of the Gospel stories. He took this interest further, and into the realm of Christian paintings and their meaning, in Painting the Word, written while he was Dean of Christ Church, Oxford. Music at Midnight is the culmination of a lifetime&#39;s interest in Herbert, whose Complete Poetry he is now editing for Penguin Classics.</p><p>John Drury is Chaplain and Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford.

Music at Midnight is the culmination of a lifetime&#39;s interest in Herbert, whose Complete Poetry he is now editing for Penguin Classics.*Starred Review* The greatest religious poet in the English language, George Herbert (1593&#x2013;1633) was a scion of powerful Anglo-Welsh aristocrats who elected, eventually, to be a country parson. Given the finest of educations at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge, he emerged as one of the foremost Latinists of his time and, still under 30, University Orator, a stepping-stone to lofty diplomatic posts. He became disillusioned, however, and resigned, took holy orders, and concluded his days as rector of little Bemerton in south central England. All along, he wrote poetry in Latin as well as English. The year after his death, the English poems were published as The Temple, one of the most successful and influential books of the seventeenth century. To relate Herbert&#x2019;s life, Drury constantly draws on his poetry in what is as much a work of literary analysis as biography. Fortunately, Herbert&#x2019;s poems, full of common knowledge, not aristocratic or scholarly sophistication, and whose core terms and references are biblical, yield plenty of intimate, real-life information. Once one knows the Christian matrix of Herbert&#x2019;s writing, his poems are startlingly, affectingly clear, and one can attend to their great though always humble wit, their limpid and cleanly moving music. Drury gives us that knowledge in this engrossing and restorative book. --Ray Olson</p><h2>1815: The Waterloo Campaign The German Victory</h2><p>25 illustrations, 25 maps 6 x 9 Demonstrates the decisive German contribution to victory at Waterloo Unpublished German eyewitness accounts and regimental reports Covers the battles of Waterloo, Wavre and the taking of Paris <p>Peter Hofschrer, in this second volume of his masterly study of 1815, challenges the accepted version of events at the battle of Waterloo.

She lives in Seattle.<p></p><b>One</b><p></p><p>The mu?ed thud of the shattered lock echoed like a thunderclap in the deep silence that drenched the cottage. Evangeline Ames recognized the sound at once. She was no longer alone in the house.</p><p>Her ?rst, primal instinct was to go absolutely still beneath the covers. Perhaps she was mistaken. The cottage was old. The ?oorboards and the ceiling often creaked and moaned at night. But even as the commonsense possibilities ?itted through her head, she knew the truth. It was two o&#x2019;clock in the morning, an intruder had broken in and it was highly unlikely that he was after the silver. There was not enough in the place to tempt a thief.</p><p>Her nerves had been on edge all afternoon, her intuition ?ickering and ?aring for no obvious reason. Earlier, when she had walked into town, she had found herself looking over her shoulder again and again. She had ?inched at the smallest rustling noises in the dense woods that bordered the narrow lane. While shopping in Little Dixby&#x2019;s crowded high street the hair had lifted on the back of her neck. She had felt as if she was being watched.</p><p>She had reminded herself that she was still recovering from the terrifying attack two weeks ago. She had very nearly been murdered. Little wonder her nerves were so fragile. On top of that, the writing was not going well and a deadline was looming. She dared not miss it. She&#x2019;d had every reason to be tense.</p><p>But now she knew the truth. Her psychical intuition had been trying to send a warning for hours. That was the reason she had been unable to sleep tonight.</p><p>Cool currents of night air wafted down the hall from the kitchen. Heavy footsteps sounded. The intruder was not even bothering to conceal his approach. He was very certain of his prey. She had to get out of the bed.</p><p>She pushed back the covers, sat up quietly and eased herself to her feet. The ?oorboards were chilly. She stepped into her sturdy, leather-soled slippers and took her wrapper down o? the hook.</p><p>The assault on her person two weeks earlier had made her cautious. She had considered all possible escape routes when she had rented the cottage. Here in the bedroom, the waist-high window was her best hope. It opened onto the small front garden with its lattice gate. Just outside the gate was the narrow, rutted lane that wound through the dense woods to the ancient country house known as Crystal Gardens.</p><p>Out in the hall a ?oorboard creaked under the weight of a booted foot. The intruder was moving directly to the bedroom. That settled the matter. He had not come for the silver. He had come for her.</p><p>There was no point trying to silence her movements. She pushed one of the narrow casement windows wide, ignoring the squeak of the hinges, and clambered through the opening. With luck the intruder would not be able to ? t.</p><p>&#x201c;Where do you think you&#x2019;re going, you bloody stupid woman?&#x201d; the harsh male voice roared from the doorway. It was freighted with the accents of London&#x2019;s tough streets. &#x201c;No one slips away from Sharpy Hobson&#x2019;s blade.&#x201d;</p><p>There was no time to wonder how a London street criminal had found his way to Little Dixby or why he was after her. She would worry about those questions later, she thought, if she survived the night.</p><p>She jumped to the ground and stumbled through the miniature jungle of giant ferns that choked the little garden. Many of the fronds were taller than she was.</p><p>To think she had come to the countryside to rest and recuperate from recent events.</p><p>&#x201c;Bloody hell, come back here,&#x201d; Hobson howled from the bedroom window. &#x201c;Make things di?cult, will ye? I&#x2019;ll take my time with ye when I do catch you, just see if I don&#x2019;t. You&#x2019;ll die nice and slow, and that&#x2019;s a promise. Bloody little bitch.&#x201d;</p><p>A string of savage curses told her that Hobson was ?nding it impossible to squeeze through the casement window. A tiny whisper of hope swept through her when she did not hear the pounding of footsteps behind her. Hobson would be forced to use one of the two doors in the cottage. That meant she had a little breathing room, time enough, perhaps, to make it to the only possible sanctuary.</p><p>There was no escape through the woods that bordered the lane. The moon was nearly full but the heavy canopy of summer leaves blocked the silver light that should have dappled the forest ?oor. Even if she&#x2019;d had a lantern, she would not have been able to make her way through the dense undergrowth. She knew just how impenetrable the vegetation in the vicinity of the old abbey was because she had attempted to explore it during the day. The trees and undergrowth around the ancient ruins ?ourished in what the locals whispered was an unnatural manner.</p><p>She found the graveled garden walk and ?ew down it, the hem of the wrapper ?apping wildly. She paused long enough to unlatch the gate and then she was out in the moonlit lane, running for her life. She knew that Hobson would see her as soon as he emerged from the cottage.</p><p>Heavy footfalls thudded behind her.</p><p>&#x201c;I have ye now, ye silly bitch. Ye&#x2019;ll soon get a taste of Sharpy&#x2019;s blade.&#x201d;</p><p>She risked a quick glance over her shoulder and saw the dark ?gure bearing down on her. She would have screamed but there was no point wasting her breath. She ran harder, heart pounding.</p><p>The ancient stone walls that protected the vast grounds of Crystal Gardens appeared impregnable in the moonlight. She knew from previous explorations that the massive iron gate was locked.</p><p>There was no point trying to run the length of the long wall to the front door of the sprawling country house. There was no time. Hob-son was gaining on her. His footsteps were closer now. She could hear his harsh breathing, or perhaps it was her own labored gasps that she heard.</p><p>She reached the back wall of the ancient abbey and raced toward the mound of overgrown foliage that concealed the jagged hole in the stone barrier. She had discovered the opening a few days ago and had decided to indulge in some discreet exploration before the new owner had arrived to take up residence. She could not help herself. Her sense of curiosity was linked in some ways to her psychical talent and the mystery of Crystal Gardens had fascinated her from the start. It was the reason she had chosen to rent Fern Gate Cottage instead of one of the other properties available in the countryside around Little Dixby.</p><p>The fact that the rent on the cottage was considerably cheaper than it was for the other suitable lodgings in the area had also been a factor. But she had discovered soon enough why the little house was a bargain. The locals feared the abbey and the woods around it.</p><p>She slammed to a stop in front of the concealing foliage and pulled aside a curtain of cascading greenery. The jagged opening in the stone was about two feet above ground level. It was large enough for a person, even a man the size of Hobson, to squeeze through. But if he did pursue her onto the grounds she might have a chance.</p><p>She looked back one last time. Hobson had not yet rounded the corner of the wall but he would at any second. She could hear him&#x2014;his thudding footsteps and his ragged breathing&#x2014;but she could not yet see him. She had a few seconds.</p><p>She put one leg over the broken stone and then the other and then she was inside the grounds of Crystal Gardens.</p><p>She caught her breath, trans?xed by the eerie scene that surrounded her. She had seen enough of the strange gardens by day to know that there was something bizarre about the energy inside the walls and that the vegetation was not normal. But at night the paranormal elements were unmistakable.</p><p>The foliage on the vast grounds glowed with an eerie luminescence. In the very center of the gardens where the ruins of an ancient Roman bath were said to be located, the psychical light was as dark and ominous as a violent storm at sea.</p><p>She knew from the guidebooks that she had purchased from Miss Witton, the proprietor of the bookshop in Little Dixby, that Crystal Gardens was divided into two sections. The outer region in which she stood was called the Day Garden on the maps. It surrounded the walls of an elaborate maze, which, in turn, encircled the interior portion of the grounds known as the Night Garden.</p><p>In the nearly two weeks that she had resided in Fern Gate Cottage she had not ventured much farther into the gardens than where she was tonight. But she had seen enough to know that the peculiar nature of the atmosphere inside the walls would provide her with her best chance of escaping Sharpy Hobson&#x2019;s knife.</p><p>There was a steady stream of curses as Hobson yanked and clawed at the foliage.</p><p>&#x201c;No little whore gets away with making Sharpy Hobson look the fool. I&#x2019;ll teach you to show some respect, see if I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>She looked around, summoning up a mental image of the layout of the gardens. The maze was the obvious place to hide. Her talent would very likely ensure that she did not get lost inside. But on a prior expedition she had discovered that a locked gate blocked the entrance to the labyrinth.</p><p>She started toward the gazebo. The graceful domed roof and the pillars glowed with a faint blue light that seemed to emanate from the very stone of which it was constructed. She hurried but she did not run. She wanted Hobson to see her.</p><p>He ?nally scrambled through the hole in the wall, grunting and swearing. She stopped and looked back, wondering how much of the paranormal light he could perceive. There was a shocked silence as Hobson took in his surroundings.</p><p>&#x201c;What the ?amin&#x2019; hell?&#x201d; he growled. He rubbed his eyes.</p><p>Then he saw her and promptly forgot about the strangely luminous landscape around him. He yanked a knife out of the leather sheath at his hip and lunged toward her.</p><p>&#x201c;Thought you&#x2019;d get away from me, did ye?&#x201d; he growled.</p><p>She whirled back toward the gazebo. Her goal was the darkly gleaming pond in front of the structure. With luck Hobson would not be able to see it until it was too late. Her senses told her that if he tumbled into the gleaming black pool he would quickly lose interest in her. There was something nightmarish about those waters.</p><p>She was so focused on her plan to lure Hobson to the pond that she was unaware of the presence of the man in the long black coat until he walked out of the shadows and into the moonlight. He stopped directly in front of her, blocking her path.</p><p>&#x201c;Is it the custom around here for visitors to call at such an unusual hour?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>His voice was as dark as the obsidian surface of the pond and charged with a similar chilling power. It stirred all of her senses. In the strange moon-and-energy-lit shadows it was di?cult to make out the man&#x2019;s face clearly but there was no need to see him. She recognized him immediately. Indeed, she thought, she would know him anywhere. Lucas Sebastian, the mysterious new owner of Crystal Gardens.</p><p>She stumbled to a halt, trapped between Lucas and Sharpy Hobson.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Sebastian,&#x201d; she said. She was breathless and her heart was pounding. She struggled to identify herself, afraid he would not recognize her in the darkness, dressed, as she was, in her wrapper and nightgown, her hair falling around her shoulders. They had met only the one time, after all. &#x201c;Sorry to intrude like this. Evangeline Ames, your tenant at Fern Gate Cottage.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know who you are, Miss Ames.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You did say to call upon you if I had a problem. As it happens, I do have one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can see that,&#x201d; Lucas said.</p><p>Hobson pulled up short. He made a slashing motion with the knife. &#x201c;Get out of my way and ye won&#x2019;t get hurt. I just want the little whore.&#x201d;</p><p>Lucas regarded him with what could only be described as detached curiosity. &#x201c;You are trespassing. That is a very dangerous thing to do here at Crystal Gardens.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on in this place?&#x201d; Hobson looked around uneasily.</p><p>&#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t you heard the stories?&#x201d; Lucas asked. &#x201c;Everyone around here knows that these grounds are haunted.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sharpy Hobson ain&#x2019;t afraid of no ghosts,&#x201d; Hobson vowed. &#x201c;Won&#x2019;t be hanging around long enough to meet one. All I want is this bitch.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you want with Miss Ames?&#x201d; Lucas asked.</p><p>Evangeline was ?oored by Lucas&#x2019;s matter-of-fact tone. It was as if he was only casually interested in Hobson&#x2019;s reasoning.</p><p>&#x201c;None of yer bloody business,&#x201d; Hobson snarled. &#x201c;But I can tell ye she&#x2019;s worth a nice bit of blunt dead and I&#x2019;m not going to let anyone get in my way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t seem to comprehend the situation,&#x201d; Lucas said. &#x201c;The lady is my tenant and therefore under my protection.&#x201d; Hobson snorted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing you a favor taking her o? your hands. The way I heard it, she&#x2019;s a lying little bitch.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Someone hired you to kill her?&#x201d; Lucas asked.</p><p>Hobson was starting to appear uncertain.

Evangeline had just time enough time to realize that Lucas was somehow generating it and then Hobson was shrieking with raw, mindless panic.</p><p>&#x201c;No, get away from me,&#x201d; he shouted.

He was constructed like some ancient granite monolith and looked as if he would be just as impervious to the elements. The moonlight gleamed on his shaved head.

Every day more than 1,000 people&#x2014;men, women, and children&#x2014;flee these three countries for North America. �scar Mart�nez, author of <i>The Beast</i>, named one of the best books of the year by the <i>Economist</i>, <i>Mother Jones</i>, and the <i>Financial Times</i>, fleshes out these stark figures with true stories, producing a jarringly beautiful and immersive account of life in deadly locations.<br><br> Mart�nez travels to Nicaraguan fishing towns, southern Mexican brothels where Central American women are trafficked, isolated Guatemalan jungle villages, and crime-ridden Salvadoran slums. With his precise and empathetic reporting, he explores the underbelly of these troubled places. He goes undercover to drink with narcos, accompanies police patrols, rides in trafficking boats and hides out with a gang informer. The result is an unforgettable portrait of a region of fear and a subtle analysis of the North American roots and reach of the crisis, helping to explain why this history of violence should matter to all of us.</p><p><b>�scar Mart�nez</b> is the author of <i>The Beast: Riding the Rails and Dodging Narcos on the Migrant Trail</i>. He writes for <i>El Faro</i>, the first online newspaper in Latin America.&#x201c;Mart�nez dives into the underworld of his subjects, navigating barrios that police won&#x2019;t enter, spending days and nights with gang members. His methods resemble war reporting and his prose is cinematic ... The collection&#x2019;s strength lies in his ability to write the hell out of his material. Like Katherine Boo&#x2019;s <i>Behind the Beautiful Forevers</i> and Adrian Nicole LeBlanc&#x2019;s <i>Random Family</i>, it skimps on statistics and analysis, instead relying on description alone to create a world that captures the reader and doesn&#x2019;t let her go. One of the stories, &#x2018;El Ni�o Hollywood&#x2019;s Death Foretold,&#x2019; evokes Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez&#x2019;s <i>Chronicle of a Death Foretold</i>. Like the beloved Colombian writer, Mart�nez pens scenes that are suspenseful, moving, and vivid.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;<i>New Republic</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Mart�nez is a gifted storyteller with an astute, observant eye and a voice that beckons to be followed ... <i>A History of Violence</i> is a necessary read, especially for US government officials crafting immigration policy against migrants and refugees from the region. It sheds light on why so many are braving the treacherous trek through Mexico to reach the United States.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Mart�nez&#x2019;s credentials for writing about this ignored human tide are impeccable: his first book, <i>The Beast</i>, drew on eight trips clinging to the roof of the infamous migrants&#x2019; train through Mexico, chronicling their desperation in grippingly graphic detail. His new book, <i>A History of Violence</i>, takes a step back to explore what the migrants heading to the US are running away from ... the unflinching cameos it paints offer a chilling portrait of corruption, unimaginable brutality and impunity.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;<i>Financial Times</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;If you take just one book to Central America on holiday, don't pick this one. Oscar Martinez has written a punishing account of the lives of the poor in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Melding acuity and anger, he unveils the scary realities of organised crime ...&nbsp;Mr Martinez deserves credit for bringing it so effectively to life.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2014;<i>Economist</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;As the current wave of US Immigration and Customs raids authorised by President Obama deports Latino migrants, and Donald Trump boosts his election campaign with promises to build a wall along the US&#x2013;Mexican border, Mart�nez endeavours to explain why, for many Central Americans of the northern triangle, returning home is a death sentence.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2014;<i>Independent </i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Ripped from the headlines, these are powerful stories of Central America&#x2019;s chaotic and bloody present, sure to raise awareness among a broad audience of North Americans, whom Mart�nez refuses to let off the hook. &#x2018;The solution?&#x2019; he asks. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s up to you.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;In Spanish, the tradition of the cr�nica is in-depth testimonial reportage blended with personal essay, and Mart�nez is a worthy inheritor. Mart�nez&#x2019;s work conveys an intimate knowledge of the social and criminal ecosystem&#x2014;both macro-level context and telling minutiae. But because he isn&#x2019;t afraid to follow dangerous paths, the result are jewels with moments of intense emotion presented against a historical background that contemplates military, social, economic, religious, psychosclogical and all sorts of other factors ... I am in awe of Mart�nez&#x2019;s commanding style. &#x201d; <br><b> &#x2014;Ilan Stavans,&nbsp;<i>In These Times</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;El Salvador&#x2019;s best chronicler of this profound crisis is �scar Mart�nez, a journalist based in San Salvador. Mart�nez has dedicated his career to documenting how the matrix of poverty, instability, and narcotrafficking has transformed the lives and prospects of Central Americans. As a writer, he&#x2019;s a committed, old-school social realist, and traveled with migrants on their deadly northward route for his previous book about Central American migration, <i>The Beast</i>. His methods in <i>A History of Violence</i> are equally painstaking.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2014;Caille Millner, <i>New Inquiry</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Agonizing stories ... [Mart�nez] urges readers to understand what Central Americans are going through and what compels them to seek refuge in the United States.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Ram�n Renter�a, <i>El Paso Times</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Dives deep to the problems driving the region's violence and impunity ...&nbsp;If <i>The Beast</i> was a look at the dangers of the journey, <i>A History of Violence</i>&nbsp;focuses on why people take it to begin with.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Jared Goyette, PRI&#x2019;s <i>The World</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Succeeds in fostering a better understanding of Central America&#x2019;s crisis of violence and the resulting surge in migration. By itself, such understanding cannot bring about the peaceful future that Mart�nez clearly hopes for. But if his work raises greater awareness of the situation in the region, and spurs at least some readers into action, it will have accomplished its purpose. <i>A History of Violence</i> is a timely publication, and not only because of the ongoing exodus from the isthmus. The new US president&#x2019;s policy agenda portends to have an unprecedented impact on migration and security policies in the Western Hemisphere. The ability to step back, reflect, and stand with vulnerable populations suddenly seems more critical than Mart�nez may have imagined when he penned these chronicles.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Sonja Wolf, <i>Current History</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;In this collection, Martinez, a journalist whose acerbic prose enlivens its dire subjects, covers stories that illuminate why so many Central Americans are willing to risk their lives to cross the border to the United States (and why, instead of calling them illegal or undocumented, we should be calling them refugees).&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Mauro Javier Cardenas, <i>The Millions</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;<i>A History of Violence</i> is not simply about storytelling, and despite the gruesome subject matter, is certainly not sensationalist journalism ... �scar Mart�nez is a passionately engaged reporter who goes under the surface to get to the truth.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Ramor Ryan, <i>TeleSur</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;No place is dangerous enough to quell Mart�nez&#x2019;s hunger for the truth, as the intrepid newshound sniffs around in occupied prisons, grim police stations, hellish whorehouses, desolate crack dens, isolated ranches and battered barrios, all the locales omitted from the tourism brochures. To understand how corruption operates in Central America, Mart�nez goes to where it operates ... gritty journalism.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Hector Luis Alamo, <i>Latino Rebels</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Reading Salvadoran journalist �scar Mart�nez&#x2019;s nonfiction portrait of violence in Central America, it seems fantastically lucky for all of us that he&#x2019;s still alive ... The reporting is an act of courage; the book is a plea for comprehension of the terror that drives people from Central America to the United States ... Mart�nez&#x2019;s portrait of Central America as killing field is a plea not only for comprehension of immigrants&#x2019; race for the border but also for empathy.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Nancy Nusser, <i>Texas Observer</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Mart�nez draws readers into this complex narrative by alternating between a panoramic social sweep and the beleaguered lives of civilians, victims, gang members, and cops, capturing the multilayered nature of a place whose indigenous traditions are being brutalized by modern criminals who commit murder casually ...&nbsp;Smart, angry immersive journalism from an author who warrants wider readership on this side of the border.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Mart�nez tenaciously reports piece by piece on the accretion of gang-related violence besetting El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala ... Mart�nez's reporting reveals shocking failures of the state&#x2014;particularly of police and courts&#x2014;but he avoids tidy lessons, preferring to let the intractable issues stand in all their cold brutality.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;<i>A History of Violence</i> ... stays close to the lives of gang members, victims of violence, and the quixotic public officials who try to offer some answers in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala ... Mart�nez avoids the literature&#x2019;s usual magnification of criminals&#x2019; power and pays attention to the fluid alliances and personal relations that determine, as one Honduran intelligence office puts it, &#x2018;who&#x2019;s in charge now.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Pablo Piccato, <i>Public Books</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;A haunting portrait of a tragic, complicated part of the world.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2014;<i>Shelf Awareness</i></b></p><h2>What If You Had Animal Teeth?</h2><p>If you could have any animal's front teeth, whose would you choose?<br><i>WHAT&nbsp;IF&nbsp;YOU&nbsp;HAD&nbsp;ANIMAL&nbsp;TEETH?</i>&nbsp;takes children on a fun, informative, and imaginative journey as they explore what it would be like if their own front teeth were replaced by those of a different animal. Featuring a dozen animals (beaver, great white shark, narwhal, elephant, rattlesnake, naked mole rat, hippopotamus, crocodile, and more), this book explores how different teeth are especially adapted for an animal's survival. At the end of the book, children will discover why their own teeth are just right for them. And they'll also get a friendly reminder to take good care of their teeth, because they're the only teeth they'll ever have. Each spread features a photograph of the animal using its specialized teeth on the left and a humorous illustrated image of a child using that animal's teeth on the right. <br><br></p><p><p>Sandra Markle is the author of more than two hundred children's books, which have won numerous awards, including Boston Globe-Horn Book Honor Book, IRA/CBC Children's Choice, NSTA/CBC Outstanding Trade Books for Children, NCTE Orbis Pictus Recommended, and ALA Notable Books for Children.

He lives in Kingston Upon Thames, England, with his wife, Rebecca.</p>Losing a first tooth is a memorable milestone in the life of a young person. Markle uses this universal experience to pose a relevant, though slightly unsettling, scientific inquiry: &#x201c;But what if an animal&#x2019;s teeth grew in, instead?&#x201d; In a fashion germane to her audience, she presents interesting animal trivia via examples and common happenings in their own lives&#x2014;for example, if you had naked mole rat teeth, you could operate them separately like chopsticks. McWilliam&#x2019;s huge-jawed illustrations, such as a young Inuit fishing with a narwhal tusk or a frustrated student mowing through his math book with a beaver&#x2019;s orange-colored incisors, are somehow both hilarious and terrifying. Meanwhile, photos of open-mouthed animals accompany the text. Though perhaps not the best choice for the nightmare-prone, this will surely satisfy animal enthusiasts and trivia lovers, and dentists and parents will appreciate the mention of ways to keep human chompers healthy.

Chase owes his current social cachet to an ongoing tragedy much covered in the tabloids: His teenage sweetheart and fianc�e, Janice Trumbull, is trapped by a layer of low-orbit mines on the International Space Station, from which she sends him rapturous and heartbreaking love letters. Like Janice, Chase is adrift, she in Earth's stratosphere, he in a vague routine punctuated by Upper East Side dinner parties.<br><br>Into Chase's cloistered city enters Perkus Tooth, a wall-eyed free-range pop critic whose soaring conspiratorial riffs are fueled by high-grade marijuana, mammoth cheeseburgers, and a desperate ache for meaning. Perkus's countercultural savvy and voracious paranoia draw Chase into another Manhattan, where questions of what is real, what is fake, and who is complicit take on a life-shattering urgency. Along with Oona Laszlo, a self-loathing ghostwriter, and Richard Abneg, a hero of the Tompkins Square Park riot now working as a fixer for the billionaire mayor, Chase and Perkus attempt to unearth the answers to several mysteries that seem to offer that rarest of artifacts on an island where everything can be bought: Truth.<br><br>Like Manhattan itself, Jonathan Lethem's masterpiece is beautiful and tawdry, tragic and forgiving, devastating and antic, a stand-in for the whole world and a place utterly unique.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, October 2009:</strong> Jonathan Lethem, the home-grown frontrunner of a generation of Brooklyn writers, crosses the bridge to Manhattan in <i>Chronic City</i>, a smart, unsettling, and meticulously hilarious novel of friendship and real estate among the rich and the rent-controlled. Lethem's story centers around two unlikely friends, Chase Insteadman, a genial nonentity who was once a child sitcom star and now is best known as the loyal fianc� of a space-stranded astronaut, and Perkus Tooth, a skinny, moody, underemployed cultural critic. Chase and Perkus are free-floating, dope-dependent bohemians in a borough built on ambition, living on its margins but with surprising access to its centers of power, even to the city's billionaire mayor. Paranoiac Perkus sees urgent plots everywhere--in the font of <i>The New Yorker</i>, in an old VHS copy of <i>Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid</i>--but <i>Chronic City</i>, despite the presence of death, politics, and a mysterious, marauding tiger, is itself light on plot. Eschewing dramatic staples like romance and artistic creation for the more meandering passions of friendship and observation, <i>Chronic City</i> thrives instead on the brilliance of Lethem's ear and eye. Every page is a pleasure of pitch-perfect banter and spot-on cultural satire, cut sharply with the melancholic sense that being able to explain your city doesn't make you any more capable of living in it. <i>--Tom Nissley</i>JONATHAN LETHEM is the author of seven novels.

At that time I observed repeatedly how correct diet, combined with proper herbal medicine and lifestyle, can play a vital role in healing. I became increasingly aware that illness provides an "invitation" to change one&#x2019;s habitual patterns. <p>As my awareness grew about the role of food as medicine, I observed that many health problems seemed intertwined with the stresses of daily life. These include worries about one&#x2019;s job or money, tension and even the stress created by eating the wrong kinds of food and improper food combining. In the last twenty years I have seen many problems, sometimes culminating in serious illness, that were the result of poor food choices and ignorance of the art of proper cooking for oneself and for the family. </p><p>In this book you will find simple, practical approaches to food and specific recipes from the Ayurvedic art of cooking to help restore the body&#x2019;s healthful balance. Though there is much helpful information within these covers, this book is not proposed as a treatment plan for any disease. This, of course, you must obtain from your own doctor. </p><p>I met my wife Usha at the Ayurvedic Hospital in Pune where she was a student of Ayurvedic nursing. After we were married, Usha began using her knowledge and love of Ayurveda as her guiding light in preparing our meals.

In recognition of the renewed interest in his life and work, The Countryman Press is proud to reissue this classic text, with a new appreciation of her late husband by Laura Waterman.</strong></p> In this environmental call to action, Laura and Guy Waterman look beyond preserving the ecology of the backcountry to focus on what they call its spiritual dimension--its fragile, untamed wildness. "Without some management, wildness cannot survive the number of people who seek to enjoy it," they write. "But with too much management, or the wrong kind, we can destroy the spiritual component of wildness in our zeal to preserve its physical side." Trailside huts and lodges, large groups seeking "wilderness experiences," federal and state regulations, and technology such as radios, cell phones, global positioning devices, and emergency helicopters, all have an impact on our experience. With humor and insight, the Watermans explore these difficult wilderness management issues. They ask us to evaluate the impact that even "environmentally conscious" values have on the wilderness experience, and to ask the question: What are we trying to preserve?</p><p><p><em>Wilderness Ethics</em> was <strong>Guy Waterman</strong>&#x2019;s most determined and philosophical statement. He died in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.</p><p><strong>Laura Waterman</strong> is co-author of several books with her husband, Guy. She lives near their original homestead in Vermont.</p>These complementary works by the Watermans, dedicated New England hikers and climbers, address the paradox that those who enjoy the wilderness most can be its most dangerous destroyers. When recreationists are few, equipment simple, and wild areas inaccessible, there is little impact on the physical ability of the land to renew itself or on the intangible experience of wildness. But the growth of backwoods recreation now threatens both the natural environment and the wilderness experience. To counter the effects of increasing numbers, the Watermans offer sensible and sensitive guidelines for a new ethics of stewardship. The second edition of Backwoods Ethics (whose first edition was reviewed in LJ 12/15/79) details how low-impact hiking and camping and regular trail tending can prevent damage to wild ecosystems. Among the authors' specific recommendations are substituting hammocks for tents and portable stoves for wood fires. The more philosophical Wilderness Ethics examines the purpose of wilderness preservation and evaluates outdoors activities and technologies as they affect the adventure, silence, and sense of remoteness from the outside world that make up the wilderness experience. Some things--large groups, TVs, and radios--simply do not belong in the wilderness. Yet the authors are never shrill or dogmatic. Their style is friendly and humorous; in sharing their concerns and doubts with readers, they encourage us to "think how we can best protect the backwoods environment."

At his side is Maggie Koderer, who finds herself powerfully drawn to the gorgeous, used up animals of the cheap track. She also lands in the cross-hairs of leading trainer Joe Dale Bigg. But as news of Tommy&#x2019;s plan spreads, from veteran groom Medicine Ed, to loan shark Two-Tie, to Kidstuff the blacksmith, it&#x2019;s Maggie, not Tommy or the handlers of legendary stakes horse Lord of Misrule, who will find what's valuable in a world where everything has a price.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, December 2010</strong>: It is nearly impossible not to be drawn into horseracing cliches when describing Jaimy Gordon's novel <em>Lord of Misrule</em>, especially since it came out of the pack as a dark horse (there you go) to win the 2010 National Book Award for fiction the same week it was published. It's a novel of the track, and Gordon embraces racing's lingo and lore and even some of its romance of longshot redemption, though she knows those bets never really come in, at least the way you think they will. Her story is set at a backwater half-mile track in West Virginia in the early '70s, the sort of place where people wash up or get stuck or, if they're particularly cruel, carve out a provincial fiefdom. The horses there are washed up too but still somehow glorious, and they're as vividly and individually defined as the people who build their lives around them. Between horse and handler there's a sort of cross-species alchemy that, along with Gordon's gorgeous language and wise storytelling, provides the central beauty of her mud-caked but mythic tale, which Maggie, one of her most compelling characters, comes the closest to describing: "On the last little spit of being human, staring through rags of fog into the not human, where you weren't supposed to be able to see let alone cross, she could make a kind of home." <em>--Tom Nissley</em><b>NATIONAL BESTSELLER<br>National Book Award Winner<br>PEN/Faulkner Award Finalist</b><br><br>Jaimy Gordon's third novel, <i>Bogeywoman</i> was on the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> list of Best Books for 2000. Her second novel, <i>She Drove Without Stopping</i>, brought her an Academy-Institute Award for her fiction from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Gordon's short story, "A Night's Work," which shares a number of characters with <i>Lord of Misrule</i>, appeared in <i>Best American Short Stories 1995. </i>She is also the author of a novella, <i>Circumspections from an Equestrian Statue</i>, and the fantasy classic novel <i>Shamp of the City-Solo</i>.

Word of mouth, critical acclaim, and a string of major awards helped propel Cartoon Books and Bone to the forefront of the comic book industry. In the spring of 2005, Harry Potter&#39;s U.S. publisher Scholastic released the first-ever full color version of the book Bone: Out from Boneville, bringing the comic book to a new audience and a new generation.Captain Marvel returns in a new incarnation, aimed at a younger audience, by Smith, the award-winning creator of Bone. Billy Batson, a young orphan living in a condemned building, follows a mysterious figure into the subway one day and is taken to a wizard who tells him that just by speaking one word&#x2014;Shazam!&#x2014;he can transform into the superpowered Captain Marvel. His brand-new ability arrives none too soon, because talking alligators and giant robots are showing up all over the city. Unfortunately, Billy has just learned something else&#x2014;he has a sister who is not content to wait on the sidelines while Billy gets to save the world. Smith brings to this project his considerable talent in creating comics that are as fun for children as they are for adults. The art is brightly colored and engaging, and the young characters at the center of the story are adorable. Unfortunately, the heavy-handed political allegory takes away from the charm somewhat. Longtime fans of the series may be dismayed by the radical changes to the continuity. Newcomers, however, will find plenty to be entertained by in Smith's lively reinvention. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As their plane approaches the airport, a cloud of black smoke billows over the Manhattan skyline. When they land, they learn of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. All flights are canceled; the sisters cannot go home, and they are stranded with boxes and boxes of roses.<br><br>In the days that followed September 11, Jeanette Winter was drawn to Union Square and saw, among the hundreds of memorial offerings, twin towers made of roses. In the pages of this small and vibrant book, she tells a moving story.<br></p><p><b>Jeanette Winter</b> is the author and illustrator of many notable books for children, including <i>Beatrix</i> and <i>Emily Dickinson's Letters to the World,</i> a <i>New York Times Book Review </i>Notable Children's Book of the Year. She lives in New York City.<br>Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2013;Based on a factual anecdote, this book recounts the story of two sisters from South Africa who are stranded in New York in the aftermath of September 11. The women, who are flying with 2400 roses for a flower show, land right after the Twin Towers are hit. A stranger offers them a place to stay. Wanting to repay this kindness, they take their flowers to Union Square and arrange them in the shape of the fallen towers amid the many other memorials. The pen-and-ink illustrations begin in color but dramatically turn to black and white when the events of 9/11 take over. Color gently returns through the appearance of the rose and candle memorials. The spare and poetic text, small-sized format, and simple drawings give these painful days a direct and personal resonance. Because of the script font and the format, this book works best one-on-one rather than for beginning readers or group sharing. While this story will not explain what happened on 9/11 to children too young to remember it, Winter's offering captures the intensity of emotion that was felt that day and the healing human connections that soon followed.<i>&#x2013;Rachel G.

More fundamentally, Chamberlain reclaims Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) from clich�, replacing the misogynist, protofascist madman of myth with a vulnerable human being--proud, lonely, an avid walker and eater--who questioned all received wisdom in his effort to give men and women their freedom. Chamberlain's elegant text is passionately personal, buttressed by careful scholarship. She succeeds admirably in her goal "to befriend Nietzsche."Praise for <i>Nietzsche in Turin</i>:<p> "Original and enlightening...In prose that is complex, free associative and richly allusive, [Chamberlain] seeks to plumb Nietzsche's mind." --Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, <i>The New York Times</i></p><p> "Elegant and sympathetic...[Nietzsche] emerges as a kind, awkward man with an immense, unsatisfied hunger for love." --Alain de Botton, <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i></p><p> "[An] excellent account of Nietzsche's last days...[Chamberlain] succeeds to a surprising degree in communicating a sense of the man and the thinker, in all his strangeness." --John Banville, <i>The New York Review of Books</i></p><p> "[A] moving account...[Chamberlain] restores a human face to the maligned philosopher....She is an acute literary and psychological interpreter of Nietzsche's work." --Kenneth Baker, <i>San Francisco Examiner &amp; Chronicle</i></p><p> "In this fascinating 'intimate biography'...Chamberlain discovers that the philosopher of the Ubermensch was actually Human." --<i>The New Yorker</i></p></p><h2>Arabesque: Sumptuous Food From Morocco Turkey And Lebanon</h2><p>In the 1960s Claudia Roden introduced Americans to a new world of tastes in her classic <i>A Book of Middle Eastern Food.</i> Now, in her enchanting new book, <i>Arabesque</i>, she revisits the three countries with the most exciting cuisines today&#x2014;Morocco, Turkey, and Lebanon.

Amina fingered the faint half-moon on her forearm, sinking a little in her seat.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Hullohullohullo!&#x201d; Sunil shouted as the car parked. &#x201c;Welcome, welcome!&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Sunil.&#x201d; Thomas opened the door, taking long strides across the lawn to shake hands. &#x201c;Good to see you.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>This was a lie, of course, as neither of the brothers was ever particularly glad to see the other, but it was the only way to properly start a visit.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Sunil fixed a blazing smile on Kamala. &#x201c;Lovely as a rose, my dear!&#x201d; He bestowed cologney kisses on her cheek and then Amina&#x2019;s before turning and clutching his heart. &#x201c;And who is this ruddy tiger? My God, Akhil? Is that you? Blossoming into a king of the jungle, are we?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;I guess,&#x201d; Akhil sighed.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Suddenly, two hands wrapped around Amina&#x2019;s neck and squeezed hard, crushing her larynx. She pulled frantically at them, dimly aware of her mother patting Divya&#x2019;s arm in greeting, of the hot breath in her ear.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Mittack!&#x201d; Itty let go, patting her head.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Jesus!&#x201d; Amina gasped, tears in her eyes. &#x201c;Mom!&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Itty.&#x201d; Kamala smiled. She wrapped her arms around the boy, who grunted and buried his face in her neck.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Hello.&#x201d; Divya stood in front of Amina, slight, pockmarked, and branded with the expression of someone expecting the worst. &#x201c;How was the train?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;It was nice.&#x201d; Amina loved the overnight train from Madras. She loved the call of the chai-wallahs at every stop, the smell of different dinners cooking in the towns they passed. &#x201c;We got egg sandwiches.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Divya nodded. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re feeling sick now?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Sick!&#x201d; A voice snapped from behind Divya. &#x201c;Already? Which one?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Beneath the heat and the house and the blinking lights, Ammachy sat in her wicker chair on the verandah, sweating rings into a sea-foam-green sari blouse. The two years that had passed since their last visit had done nothing to soften her face. Long white whiskers grew out of her chin, and her spine, hunched by decades of complaint, left her head floating some inches above her lap.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Hello, Amma.&#x201d; Thomas&#x2019;s fingers were firm on Amina and Akhil&#x2019;s necks as he marched them up the few stairs to where she sat. &#x201c;Good to see you.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Ammachy pointed to the roll of flesh that pressed at the hem of Akhil&#x2019;s polo shirt. &#x201c;<i>Thuddya.</i> What kind of girlish hips are you growing?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Hi, Ammachy.&#x201d; Akhil leaned in to kiss her cheek.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>She turned to Amina with a wince. &#x201c;Ach. I sent some Fair and Lovely, no? Didn&#x2019;t use it?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s fine, Amma,&#x201d; Thomas said, but as Amina bent to kiss her, Ammachy snatched her face, pinning it between curled fingers.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;You will have to be very clever if you are never going to be pretty. Are you very clever?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Amina stared at her grandmother, unsure of what to say. She had never thought of herself as particularly clever. She had never thought of herself as particularly bad-looking either, though it was obvious enough now from the faint repulsion that rippled through the hairs on Ammachy&#x2019;s lip.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Amina won the all-city spelling bee,&#x201d; Kamala announced, pushing Amina&#x2019;s head forward so that her lips landed openly against Ammachy&#x2019;s cheek. She had just enough time to be surprised by the taste of menthol and roses, and then she was pulled into the too-dark house and down the hallway, past Sunil and Divya and Itty and Ammachy&#x2019;s rooms, to a dining room set with tea.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;So train was crowded? Nothing to eat? She&#x2019;s so happy to see you.&#x201d; Divya motioned for Kamala and the kids to sit and pushed a plate of orange sweets at them. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s been talking of nothing else for a month.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Itty,&#x201d; Sunil boomed, dragging a lumpy suitcase in behind him. &#x201c;Your uncle is insisting we see what presents he has brought. Shall we take a look?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Hullo?&#x201d; Itty nodded vigorously. &#x201c;Look? Look?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing, really.&#x201d; Thomas took a seat next to Amina.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Small-small things,&#x201d; Kamala added.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Ammachy limped in with a scowl. &#x201c;What is all this nonsense?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>It was: two pairs of Levi&#x2019;s, one bottle of Johnnie Walker Red, three bags of nuts (almonds, cashews, pistachios), a pair of Reeboks with Velcro closures, a larger pair of hiking boots, two bottles of perfume (Ana�s Ana�s, Chlo�), four cassette tapes (the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Kenny Rogers, Exile), two jars of Avon scented skin lotion (in Topaze and Unspoken), several pairs of white tube socks, talcum powder, and a candy-cane-shaped tube filled with marshmallow, root beer float, and peppermint flavored lip balms.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s too much.&#x201d; Sunil tried to hand back the cassette tapes. &#x201c;Really, we don&#x2019;t need.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;What need?&#x201d; Thomas smiled, watching Divya sink her finger into the jar of Avon cream. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice to have is all. What do you think, Itty? You like the Velcro?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Crouched in a Spider-Man pose on the floor, Itty lunged slowly from side to side, mesmerized by the sight of his poufy white feet.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll spoil him.&#x201d; Sunil reached for the scotch bottle, holding it up to the light and studying the label. &#x201c;Shall we try a bit of this?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;After dinner,&#x201d; Thomas said, and Sunil poured two fingers into his empty teacup, sniffing it.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;The Velcro is big thing in the States now,&#x201d; Kamala explained to everyone with a knowing look. &#x201c;Easy peasy, instead of having to tie the shoes.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Ammachy snorted. &#x201c;Who else besides this no-brains won&#x2019;t know to tie shoes?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Vel cow!&#x201d; Itty shouted with unfortunate timing, fastening and unfastening his Reeboks until Ammachy smacked him with a powdered palm. She sniffed at all three flavors of lip balm and licked the tip of one before pushing them into Divya&#x2019;s pile.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;So, you people had a good trip in the airplane?&#x201d; Ammachy asked.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Thomas nodded. &#x201c;Good enough.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;How did you come?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;San Francisco&#x2013;-Honolulu&#x2013;-Taiwan&#x2013;-Singapore.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Ammachy grunted. &#x201c;Singapore Airlines?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Those girls are pretty, no?&#x201d; She refilled Kamala&#x2019;s cup, saying, &#x201c;Nice complexions.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Try the hiking boots, Sunil.&#x201d; Thomas pointed to them with his chin. &#x201c;The heel itself has shock absorbers!&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Later. I have some work I should be attending to.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yes, this one with his <i>people&#x2019;s practice.</i>&#x201d; Ammachy rolled her eyes. &#x201c;You would think he was actually saving lives instead of teeth.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Teeth are lives, Amma,&#x201d; Sunil said, glowering. &#x201c;People need to eat to live.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;So, who all do you want to see?&#x201d; she asked Thomas.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I haven&#x2019;t thought about it yet.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Yes, well, your old classmate Yohan Varghese was asking about you the other day. I told you the wife died, no? Not that she was any real help, stupid thing, but two sons to raise on his own! Ach. And we should see Saramma Kochamma of course, just for one afternoon meal. And Dr. Abraham wants to talk to you. He&#x2019;s putting together that rehabilitative center, the one I told you about? Might be a nice thing to see.&#x201d; This last news was delivered with such practiced indifference that even Amina felt embarrassed.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Thomas reached for a jalebi. He offered the plate to Amina, who shook her head.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Anyway, he needs someone in head injuries, so I told him you would ring.&#x201d; Ammachy poured milk into her own tea and stirred. &#x201c;Maybe tomorrow?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not really my field.&#x201d; Thomas took a bite. &#x201c;They would only ever need the occasional surgery.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Well, no one asked you to become a brain surgeon,&#x201d; Ammachy snapped.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Thomas said, chewing carefully, &#x201c;they didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Akhil reached for a jalebi, and Ammachy swatted his hand away.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just an option.&#x201d; Ammachy scraped something from the oilcloth. &#x201c;But then I suppose Kamala likes it there? All of this women&#x2019;s- libbing and bra burning?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Kamala sat up a little taller in her chair.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s why she was so excited to go in the first place. Always wanting more and more of freedoms, is it?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Who burns the bras?&#x201d; Kamala asked indignantly.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;How should I know?&#x201d; Ammachy glared. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the one who chooses to live in there. Godforsaken place.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;<i>I&#x2019;m</i> the one?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Who else? If you wanted to come home, Thomas would come. Men only go as far as the wife allows.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Is that so?&#x201d; Kamala leaned across the table. &#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s very interesting, isn&#x2019;t it, Thomas?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Amma, please. We&#x2019;ve only just arrived.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s foreskin?&#x201d; Amina asked. Everyone looked at her.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;God&#x2019;s foreskin place?&#x201d; Amina repeated, and Akhil kicked her shin under the table. &#x201c;Ouch!&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;What is this child saying?&#x201d; Ammachy&#x2019;s face was rigid.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Time for naps!&#x201d; Kamala pointed toward the stairs. &#x201c;Go. You are overtired.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s the middle of the day!&#x201d; Akhil protested. &#x201c;We just got here.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Jet lags! You&#x2019;ll be cranky tomorrow if you don&#x2019;t get some rest. Go!&#x201d; Kamala stood up and ushered them to the base of the stairs, Itty hot on her heels. &#x201c;Itty, you stay with us, oka...</p></p><h2>The Gospel According to Peanuts,</h2><p><p>While Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy, Linus, and the rest of the Peanuts gang have enjoyed the kind of success most cartoon characters can only dream about--becoming pop culture icons of the highest order and entering the global consciousness practically as family members--Robert Short's <i>The Gospel According to Peanuts</i> also has found a place in the hearts of many readers, with sales now totaling more than ten million copies. This anniversary edition features a new cover, a new interior design, and a new foreword by Martin E. Marty. Whether coming to the book for the first time or taking a second look, a delightful experience awaits in this modern-day guide to the Christian faith, fully illustrated with Peanuts.</p></p><p><b>Robert L. Short</b> is perhaps best known for his first book, <i>The Gospel according to Peanuts</i>, which was lauded by <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> as "a 'perilous experiment' that comes off and earned the "admiration and respect of Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz. An ordained Presbyterian minister, he regularly traveled and preached throughout the country, presenting programs in Christian faith and the arts at churches and colleges. His other books include <i>Something to Believe In</i>, <i>The Gospel According to Dogs</i>, and <i>The Parables of Dr. Seuss</i>.In 1965, a 28 year-old pastor named Robert Short turned a popular slide show he'd been presenting while working his way through seminary into a book called The Gospel According to Peanuts using Schulz's characters to explain the Christian faith. He explained that Lucy, in her headstrong impulsiveness, often represents original sin. In the Hound of Heaven chapter, Short shows how Schulz used Snoopy to stand for Christ or ideal Christians. A small Presbyterian publishing house (John Knox) published it in hopes of inspiring some Sunday-school teachers to think outside the box, and, behold, their wish was fulfilled. Over 10 million copies were sold. Thirty-five years later the publisher has issued an anniversary edition....Short demonstrates a broad and deep grasp of Scripture, theology, and popular culture, all without any of the personal narrative that dominate today's religious bestsellers. After reading Short's Gospel, I know less about him than I do about my insurance agent. His only narrative is the gospel: original sin, the wages of sin are death, sin makes us aware of our need for redemption, salvation is entirely a work of grace motivated by divine love. --<i>From Beliefnet</i></p><h2>Soldaten: On Fighting, Killing, and Dying, The Secret WWII Transcripts of German POWS</h2><p><p>In 2001, spurred by a nagging curiosity over a transcript of a secretly recorded conversation he had come across in his research on the German U-boat wars, historian S�nke Neitzel paid a visit to the British national archives. He had heard of the existence of recorded interrogations of German POWs, but never about covert recordings taken within the confines of the holding cells, bedrooms, and camps that housed the prisoners. What Neitzel discovered, to his amazement, were reams of untouched, recently declassified transcripts totaling nearly eight hundred pages. Later, Neitzel would find another trove of protocols twice as extensive at the National Archives in Washington, D.C. <br><br> Though initially recorded by British intelligence with the intention of gaining information that might be useful for the Allied war effort, the matters discussed in these conversations ultimately proved to be limited in that regard. But for Neitzel and his collaborator, renowned social psychologist Harald Welzer, they would supply a unique and profoundly important window into the mentality of the soldiers in the Wehrmacht, the Luftwaffe, the German navy, and the military in general, almost all of whom had insisted on their own honorable behavior during the war. It is a myth these transcripts unequivocally debunk.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br> <i>Soldaten </i>closely examines these conversations, and the casual, pitiless brutality omnipresent in them, from a historical and psychological perspective. What factors led to the degradation of the soldiers&#x2019; sense of awareness and morality? How much did their social environments affect their interpretation of the war and their actions during combat? By reconstructing the frameworks and situations behind these conversations, and the context in which they were spoken, a powerful, unflinching narrative of wartime experience emerges. The details of what these soldiers did, after all, are not filtered the way they might be in letters to family, or girlfriends and wives, or during interrogations by the enemy. In <i>Soldaten,</i> S�nke Neitzel and Harald Welzer offer an unmitigated window into the mind-set of the German fighting man, potentially changing our view of World War II.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p></p><p><p>S�NKE NEITZEL is currently Chair of International History at the London School of Economics. He has previously taught modern history at the Universities of Glasgow, Saarbr�cken, Bern, and Mainz. <br> &nbsp;<br> Harald Welzer is a professor of transformation design at the University of Flensburg, teaches social psychology at the University of Sankt Gallen, and is head of the foundation Futurzwei.<br></p><i>Excerpted from the Hardcover Edition</i><br><br>What the Soldiers Discussed<br><br>&#x201c;I heard of a case of two fifteen-year-old boys. They were wearing uniform and were firing away with the rest. But they were taken prisoners. A corporal in hospital told me that. They were wearing soldiers&#x2019; uniform, so what could one do. And I myself have seen that there are twelve-year-old boys in the Russian Army, in the band, for instance, wearing uniform. We once (captured) a Russian military band and they played wonderfully. It was almost too much for you. There was such depth of feeling and yearning in their music; it conjured up pictures of the vastness of Russia. It was terrific, it thrilled me through and through. It was a military band. To get back to the story, the two boys were told to get back westward and to keep on the road. If they tried to run into the woods at the first bend of the road they would get a bullet in them. And they were scarcely out of sight when they slunk off the road, and in a flash they had disappeared. A large detachment was immediately sent to look for them, but they couldn&#x2019;t find them. And then they caught the two boys. Those were the two. (Our people) behaved well and didn&#x2019;t kill them there and then, they took them before the C.C. [concentration camp] again. Now it was clear that they&#x2019;d done for themselves. They were made to dig their own graves, two pits, and then one of them was shot. He didn&#x2019;t fall into the grave, he fell forwards over it. The other was told to push the first one into the pit before he was shot himself. And he did so, smiling&#x2014;a boy of fifteen! There&#x2019;s fanaticism and idealism for you&#x201d;!2<br><br>This story, as told by Staff Sergeant Schmid on June 20, 1942, typifies how the soldiers talk in the protocols. As in all everyday conversations, the speaker repeatedly changes the subject, following a chain of associations. In the middle, when Schmid is talking about music, it occurs to him how much he enjoys Russian music, whereupon he briefly describes it before continuing his narrative. Schmid&#x2019;s anecdote begins harmlessly enough, but turns truly horrific at the end with the execution of the two young Russian soldiers. The narrator reports that not only were the two youths murdered, they were made to dig their own graves. The execution runs into a complication, and that leads to the eventual moral of the story. The young soldier about to be killed proves &#x201c;fanatic&#x201d; or &#x201c;idealistic,&#x201d; eliciting the staff sergeant&#x2019;s admiration.<br><br>At first glance what we have here is a spectacular combination of topics&#x2014;war, enemy soldiers, youths, music, Russian expanses, crimes against humanity, and admiration for one&#x2019;s adversary&#x2014;that don&#x2019;t seem to cohere. Yet they are narrated in a single breath. That is the first thing we need to recognize. The stories we will be examining in this book deviate from what we expect. They were not intended to be well rounded, consistent, or logical. They were told to create excitement, elicit interest, or provide space and opportunity for the interlocutor to add commentary or stories of his own. In this respect, as is true for all everyday conversations, the soldiers&#x2019; stories tend to jump around in interesting ways. They are full of ruptures and sidebar narratives, and they aim to establish consensus and agreement. People do not converse solely in order to exchange information but to create a relationship with one another, establishing commonalities and assuring themselves that they are experiencing one and the same world. The soldier&#x2019;s world is that of war. That is what makes their conversations seem so extraordinary to readers today. For the soldiers themselves, they were perfectly normal.<br><br>The brutality, harshness, and absence of emotion of war are omnipresent, and that is what is so disturbing for us reading the dialogues today, more than sixty years after the fact. Involuntarily, we can only shake our heads in dismay and frequent incomprehension. Yet in order to understand the world of these soldiers, and not just our own world, we need to get beyond such moral reactions. The matter-of-factness with which extreme acts of brutality are related shows that killing and the worst sorts of violence were part of the narrator&#x2019;s and audience&#x2019;s everyday reality. The POWs discussed such topics for hours on end. But they also conversed about airplanes, bombs, radar devices, cities, landscapes, and women:<br><br>M�ller: When I was at Kharkiv the whole place had been destroyed, except the centre of the town. It was a delightful town, a delightful memory! Everyone spoke a little German&#x2014;they&#x2019;d learnt it at school. At Taganrog, too, there were splendid cinemas and wonderful caf�s on the beach. We did a lot of flying near the junction of the Don and the Donetz. . . . It&#x2019;s beautiful country; I travelled everywhere in a lorry. Everywhere we saw women doing compulsory labour service.<br><br>Faust: How frightful!<br><br>M�ller: They were employed on road-making&#x2014;extraordinarily lovely girls; we drove past, simply pulled them into the armoured car, raped them and threw them out again. And did they curse!3<br><br>Male conversations are like this. The two soldiers protocolled here, a Luftwaffe lance corporal and a sergeant, at times describe the Russian campaign like tourists, telling of &#x201c;delightful&#x201d; towns and memories. Then, suddenly, the story becomes about the spontaneous rape of female forced laborers. The sergeant relates this like a minor, ancillary anecdote, before continuing to describe his &#x201c;trip.&#x201d; This example illustrates the parameters of what can be said and what is expected in the secretly monitored conversations. None of the violence related goes against his interlocutor&#x2019;s expectations. Stories about shooting, raping, and robbing are commonplace within the war stories. Rarely do they occasion analysis, moral objections, or disagreements. As brutal as they may be, the conversations proceed harmoniously. The soldiers understand one another. They share the same world and swap perspectives on the events that occupy their minds and the things that they&#x2019;ve seen and done. They narrate and interpret these things in historically, culturally, and situatively specific frameworks of reference.<br><br>Our aim in this book is to reconstruct and describe these frameworks in order to understand what the soldiers&#x2019; world was like, how they saw themselves and their enemies, what they thought about Adolf Hitler and Nazism, and why they continued fighting, even when the war seemed already lost. We want to examine what was &#x201c;National Socialist&#x201d; about these reference frameworks and to determine whether the largely jovial men in the POW camps were indeed &#x201c;ideological warriors&#x201d; who set out in a &#x201c;war of annihilation&#x201d; to commit racist crimes and stage massacres. To what extent do these men conform to the category, popularized by Daniel Goldhagen in the 1990s, of &#x201c;willing executioners&#x201d;? Or, alternatively, do they more greatly resemble the more differentiated, morally ambiguous picture of Wehrmacht soldiers that has emerged from the popular historical exhibits by the Hamburg Institute for Social Research and countless historical examinations? Today&#x2019;s conventional wisdom is that Wehrmacht soldiers were part of a gigantic apparatus of annihilation and thus were participants in, if not executioners of, unparalleled mass murder. There is no doubt that the Wehrmacht was involved in criminal acts, from the killing of civilians to the systematic murder of Jewish men, women, and children. But that tells us nothing about how individual soldiers were involved in such criminality, or about the relationship they themselves had toward their deeds&#x2014;whether they committed crimes willingly, grudgingly, or not at all. The material here gives detailed information about the relationships between individuals and their actions and challenges our common assumptions about &#x201c;the Wehrmacht.&#x201d;<br><br>One fact needs to be acknowledged. Whatever they may encounter, human beings are never unbiased. Instead, they perceive everything through specific filters. Every culture, historical epoch, or economic system&#x2014;in short every form of existence&#x2014;influences the patterns of perception and interpretation and thus steers how individuals perceive and interpret experiences and events. The surveillance protocols reflect, in real time, how German soldiers saw and commonly understood World War II. We will show that their observations and conversations are not what we would usually imagine&#x2014;in part because they, unlike we today, did not know how the war would end and what would become of the Third Reich and its F�hrer. The soldiers&#x2019; future, both real and imaginary, is our past, but for them it was an unfinished book. Most of the soldiers are scarcely interested in ideology, politics, world orders, and anything of that nature. They wage war not out of conviction, but because they are soldiers, and fighting is their job.<br><br>Many of them are anti-Semites, but that is not identical with being &#x201c;Nazis.&#x201d; Nor does anti-Semitism have anything to do with willingness to kill. A substantial number of the soldiers hate &#x201c;the Jews&#x201d; but are shocked at the mass executions by firing squads. Some are clear &#x201c;anti-Nazis&#x201d; but support the anti-Jewish policies of Hitler&#x2019;s regime. Quite a few are scandalized at hundreds of thousands of Russian POWs being allowed to starve to death, but do not hesitate to shoot POWs themselves if it seems too time-consuming or dangerous to guard or transport them. Some complain that Germans are too &#x201c;humane&#x201d; and then tell in the same breath and in great detail how they mowed down entire villages. Many conversations feature a lot of boasting and chest-puffing, but this goes well beyond today&#x2019;s males&#x2019; bragging about themselves or their cars. Soldiers frequently seek to rack up points with tales of extreme violence, of the women they raped, the planes they shot down, or the merchant ships they sank. On occasion, we were able to determine that such stories were untrue and intended to make an impression, even by relating, for instance, how they sank a ship that was transporting children. That is beyond the pale today, but the parameters of what could be and was said then were different from what obtains today, as are the things which they hoped would elicit admiration and respect. Acts of violence, back then, belonged to that category. Most of the soldiers&#x2019; stories may initially seem contradictory, but only if we assume that people act in accordance with their &#x201c;attitudes,&#x201d; and that those attitudes are closely connected with ideologies, theories, and grand convictions.<br><br>In reality, people act as they think is expected of them. Such perceived expectations have a lot less to do with abstract &#x201c;views of the world&#x201d; than with concrete places, purposes, and functions&#x2014;and above all with the groups of which individual people are a part.<br><br>To understand and explain why German soldiers waged war for five years with a ferocity still unparalleled today, causing an eruption of violence that claimed 50 million lives and decimated an entire continent, we have to see the war, their war, through their eyes. The following chapters will be concerned in detail with the factors that influenced and determined the soldiers&#x2019; perspective, their frames of reference. Readers who are not interested in Nazi and military frames of reference and are more curious about the soldiers&#x2019; narratives and discussions about violence, technology, extermination, women, or the F�hrer should proceed directly to page 44. After we have given a detailed account of the soldiers&#x2019; views on fighting, killing, and dying, we will compare war as waged by the Wehrmacht with other wars, thereby elucidating what was specifically &#x201c;National Socialist&#x201d; about World War II. This much we can reveal in advance: the results of this examination will often be unexpected.<br><br>Seeing the War with Soldiers&#x2019; Eyes: Analyzing Frames of Reference<br><br>Human beings are not Pavlovian dogs. They don&#x2019;t react with conditioned reflexes to predetermined stimuli. Between stimulus and reaction, something highly specialized happens which epitomizes human consciousness and which distinguishes our species from all other forms of life. Humans interpret what they perceive and on the basis of interpretation draw conclusions, make up their minds, and decide what to do. Belying Marxist theory, human beings never act on the basis of objective conditions; nor do they act, as disciples of rational choice theory long wanted us to believe, solely with an eye toward cost-benefit calculations. Waging war is neither the only logical result of cost-benefit analysis nor a necessary consequence of objective circumstances. A physical body will always fall according to the laws of gravity and never otherwise, but whatever human beings do they could always have done differently. Nor do magic entities such as &#x201c;mentalities&#x201d; make people behave a certain way, although psychological structures no doubt influence what human beings do. Mentalities precede but do not determine decisions. Even if people&#x2019;s perceptions and actions are bound up with social, cultural, hierarchical, and biological or anthropological circumstances, human beings always enjoy a certain freedom of interpretation and action. But the ability to interpret and decide presupposes orientation and knowledge of what one is dealing with and what consequences a decision can have. And a frame of reference is what provides orientation.<br><br>Frames of reference vary drastically according to historical periods and cultures. Orthodox Muslims, for instance, categorize suitable and unsuitable sexual behavior within a completely different framework from that of secular inhabitants of Western society. Nonetheless, no member of either group is able to interpret what he sees outside references not of his own choice or making. They influence, guide, and even steer his perceptions and interpretations. That is not to say that transgressions of a preexisting frame of reference do not occur in special situations. It is possible to observe or think something new. But this is relatively seldom the case. Frames of reference guarantee economy of action so that most of what happens can be sorted within a familiar matrix. That makes things easier. People called upon to act don&#x2019;t need to start from the very beginning with the question: what is actually going on here? In the vast majority of cases, the answers to this question are preprogrammed and accessible, saved in a corpus of cultural orientation and knowledge. Most everyday tasks are taken care of by routines, habits, and certainties, and that saves individual human beings a colossal amount of work.<br><br>Thus when we want to explain human behavior, we first must reconstruct the frame of reference in which given human beings operated, including which factors structured their perception and suggested certain conclusions. Merely analyzing objective circumstances is inadequate. Nor do mentalities explain why someone did a specific thing, especially in cases where members of a group whose minds were all formed the same way arrive at entirely different conclusions and decisions. This is the systemic limit upon theories about ideological wars and totalitarian regimes. The question always remains: how are &#x201c;world views&#x201d; and &#x201c;ideologies&#x201d; translated into individual perceptions and interpretations and how do they affect individual behavior? In order to understand those things, we analyze frames of reference as a way of reconstructing the perceptions and interpretations of people in specific historical situations, here German soldiers during World War II.</p><h2>Saltypie: A Choctaw Journey from Darkness into Light</h2><p><p><i>Bee stings on the backside!

Providing both a chronicle of the radical sex movement in the United States, as well as the definitive opinions of America&#39;s most consistent and trenchant sexual critic, Public Sex is must-read material for anyone interested in sexual practices, feminism, censorship, or simply the art of the political essay.</p><p>Among the beacons of sex radicalism--alongside Susie Bright, Carol Queen, Kate Bornstein, and very few others--Pat Califia has been writing angry, sex-positive essays and politically charged erotica since the late 1970s. The bulk of her many nonfiction pieces is collected in this reprint of a book first published in 1994, providing a lively, informal history of the sex wars of the '80s and '90s--from the absurd, puritanical Meese Commission Report to the antiporn feminists to the unexamined attitudes behind the popular Re/Search book <i>Modern Primitives</i>. The chief apologist for the S/M community and one of the strongest voices in the anticensorship fight, Califia is at her best when the subject is closest to home. Her peevish reflections on the stupidity and political shortsightedness of anti-S/M feminists and lesbians are a joy to read; you can hear the swish of her whip and the stamp of her boot heel. With its excellent introduction, this book should be on the shelf of every feminist, every lesbian, every sexual adventurer, and anyone who hopes to understand sexual politics in America. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Pat Califia needs no introduction for lesbian and gay readers. Her writings on sexuality, pornography, censorship, S/M, and other controversial topics have earned her the reputation of a fearless defender of the rights of perverts - and a fearless intellectual adversary. Pat Califia is well-known as a long-time activist for gay rights and the right to free sexual expression, and a sharp critic of repressive American attitudes toward sexuality and pornography. She lectures widely on university campuses and at the invitation of community-sponsored conferences, workshops and other gatherings. Among her best-loved books are Sex Changes: The Politics of Transgenderism, Public Sex: The Culture of Radical Sex, The Advocate Advisor, Macho Sluts and Melting Point. Her numerous articles and essays have appeared in The Journal of Homosexuality, The Advocate, Co-Evolution Quarterly, High Times, Brat Attack, Taste of Latex, Skin Two, Invert: The Journal of Gay and Lesbian Sensibility, On Our Backs, Drummer, and The Spectator. She received her M.A. in counseling psychology from University of San Francisco. She lives in San Francisco where she writes and works as a therapist intern serving the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered communities. Pat Califia was born in 1954 in Corpus Christi, Texas. She came out as a lesbian in Salt Lake City, Utah, in the early 1970s. She was a member of the first local feminist consciousness-raising group and helped start the first women&#39;s center in Salt Lake City. Pat has said many times that she chose writing as her preferred mode of political activism because writing could go where she could not. Having grown up in Texas and Utah, she certainly experienced the pain of isolation as a future butch lesbian and genderbender. Perhaps this is why Pat has been so dogged in her insistence on sexual freedom for everyone - and so relentless in her criticism of sexual censorship, both from the feminist movement and from the Right. In 1973, Pat moved to San Francisco, where she was active in Daughters of Bilitis, the first national organization for lesbians. In the mid-1970s, she began educating herself about lesbian sex. She took volunteer training at San Francisco&#39;s Sex Information hotline, led a lesbian sexuality discussion group, worked as a research associate at the Center for Homosexual Education, Evaluation and Research at San Francisco State University under the direction of John De Cecco - and began writing Saphistry (Naiad Press, 1979) the book that sparked the famous lesbian sex wars of Reagan years. In the early 1980s, Pat was busy organizing in the lesbian S/M community, beginning with Samois. She helped produce What Color Is Your Handkerchief?, the first pamphlet on lesbian S/M in the English language, and helped edit Coming to Power, an anthology of work by S/M lesbians. In 1983, she moved to New York City and joined the Lesbian Sex Mafia. Throughout the 1980s - while S/M was viciously contested as a legitimate avenue of sexual expression for upstanding righteous feminist lesbians -Pat wrote, edited, lectured, taught, attended meetings and conferences, sat on boards, judged contests, cranked out honest, no-bullshit sex advice for The Advocate, and set the standard for heart-pounding, risk-taking, literate lesbian erotic fiction. For more than two decades, Pat Califia has been &#34;fuming and fussing&#34; about censorship and the rights of perverts in America. Whether she&#39;s writing about lesbian relationships, S/M and &#34;leather sex,&#34; sex between lesbians and gay men, eroticizing latex and safe sex, role-playing and genderbending, sex with youth, prostitution, sex in public, or the politics of transgenderism in Western culture, Califia- always clear, provocative and eminently reasonable- sets the standard for writing about sex. Califia&#39;s dedication to sexual, political and informational freedom has earned her the admiration of activists everywhere. She provided key testimony in Little Sisters&#39; censorship case against the Canadian Government. There she was put in the unenviable position of defending to a room full of government prosecutors, customs officials and bureaucrats &#34;The Surprise Party,&#34; a story full of rough sex and bondage, in which a lesbian is &#34;raped&#34; by a cadre of gay men dressed up as cops. Califia wrote in the introduction to Forbidden Passages: Writings Banned in Canada, &#34;Until the last page of this story, the reader has every reason to believe that it is a description of three cops sexually assaulting a lesbian. Then it is revealed that it was in fact a complicated, staged S/M scene produced as a labor of love for the heroine&#39;s birthday (hence, the title) I had forgotten just how twisted sexual politics can be. When liberals become censors, they come up with some novel rationales. &#39;The Surprise Party&#39; was under suspicion for potentially instigating antigay violence. The state was attempting to censor a piece of gay writing under the guise of protecting us from homophobic assaults. At one point, I believe I commented to the court that heterosexual policemen were apparently telling me as a lesbian author that I did not have the right to have sexual fantasies about cops. Nobody laughed.&#34; Since the broad consequences of sexual repression (and repression in general) are never far from Califia&#39;s mind, Califia sees sexuality where we didn&#39;t think it mattered and provides a wealth of information for concerned folks addressing seemingly non-sexual issues. Writing of proposed Internet regulations in Public Sex: The Culture of Radical Sex, she observes, &#34;The U.S. Government has used the pretext of looking for kiddy porn to institute a wide-ranging campaign of on-line surveillance and entrapment. And Great Britain has proposed to prevent all Internet newsgroups in the &#39;alt&#39; category from being transmitted into that country. These groups include discussions of kinky sex, but they also include medical information, rock &#39;n&#39; roll fandom, sci-fi readers, and a bunch of other interesting conversations. If this effort succeeds, an antiporn rationale will have been used to cut off British citizens from a rich culture capable of generating many kinds of social change.&#34; Pat Califia is available for print, on-line and broadcast interviews, and for lectures and workshops on university campuses.</p><h2>The Ghost in the Mirror (Lewis Barnavelt)</h2><p><b>It was a warm summer day in 1951 when Rose Pottinger and Mrs. Zimmermann entered the tunnel.

Having lost most of her magic in The Letter, The Witch and The Ring (1977), Florence Zimmerman travels back in time to recover it, taking along her friend Rose Rita Pottinger (14). Together, the two rescue a Pennsylvania Dutch family from an evil sorcerer, uncover an old chest of Revolutionary War gold, and activate a crystal ball that restores Mrs. Zimmerman's powers--not, of course, without negotiating plenty of cryptic instructions, apparitions, lurking evils, spells, and narrow escapes, plus a slavering demon or two. Though the deliciously ghastly climax suddenly comes to a halt so that the sorcerer can rehearse his motives and life story, the plot generally develops in a smooth and coherent fashion, driven along by a pair of active female characters. Still more stories are to come. (Fiction. 10-12) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But this poor ted has fallen out of bed. He&#x2019;s not very good at climbing, and his child won&#x2019;t wake up. How can he get back in?&nbsp;Luckily, three mice have some ideas. They take him on the adventure of his life, zooming off in fast cars, going on a balloon ride, and climbing a building-block mountain. <br>It&#x2019;s all very exciting, but will it get this poor ted back to bed?<br><br><i>One Ted Falls Out of Bed</i> is a 2007 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</p><p>Julia Donaldson is the author of many successful books for children, including <i>The Gruffalo</i> and <i>The Giants and the Joneses</i>.<br><br>Anna Currey is the author and/or illustrator of several books for children, including <i>Truffle's Christmas</i>.<br><br>PreS-Gr. 2. In a young child's room one night, a collection of toys cavort. After a teddy bear drops from the child's bed to the floor, the other toys invite him to join in their fun. Written in rhyming couplets ("They roar around in four fast cars, / Then sit and gaze at five bright stars"), Donaldson's story frames the concept of counting up to 10 and back down to 1. Currey's watercolor illustrations extend the cozy drama, starting with a quiet double-page spread of the nighttime room. Then the energy picks up in scenes that zoom in on different parts of the room filled with activities. Soon enough, the teddy bear misses bed, so all the toys pitch in to build a tower of blocks that he can climb. The tower crashes and wakes the child, who grabs her teddy bear. Of course, children will enjoy counting along with the text, but this title will also make them wonder what might be happening in their rooms after they fall asleep. <i>Kathy Broderick</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

By the creators of Pegasus. 28,000 first printing.</p><p>K-Gr 3-Mayer introduces the little hero who comes of a wish granted by Merlin to a childless farm couple and who eventually becomes the darling of King Arthur's court. In quick succession, Tom is swallowed by a cow and tickles his way out, and is snatched by a raven that drops him down the chimney of none other than the giant who has been plaguing the countryside. The protagonist offers his services around the house, but eventually the huge man's evil nature overtakes him and he eats Tom. Having already dealt with the cow, Tom gives Gembo such a case of intestinal distress that the giant coughs him into the moat, where he is eaten by an enormous salmon, which a fisherman catches and takes to King Arthur. Since Gembo has left the country in shame, Tom is knighted and feted by the court, and when he begins to miss his parents, he returns to their farm with a bag of gold coins. Mayer's fine retelling is sure to capture the fancy of young readers as happily as she's captured the spirit of the little fellow's adventures. Less wordy than older retellings, this luscious edition will find a ready audience, and the source notes will aid and satisfy teachers and researchers. Craft's opulent oil-over-watercolor illustrations will draw in even the most reluctant reader. The impish Tom, with curly red hair and freckles, is dressed in elfin finery with a tiny, magic sword strapped at his side. An appealing choice for even the youngest reader to embrace.<p></p><p><i>Jeanne Clancy Watkins, Chester County Library, Exton, PA</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>In this collaboration from the creators of Pegasus, Mayer's animated retelling of Tom Thumb's adventures and Craft's affectionate portrayal of the cherubic yet impish hero make for an enjoyable, if disjointed, read. In the time of King Arthur, Merlin uses his magic to grant Tim and Kate a son no bigger than Tim's thumb. In spite of the boy's protection by his fairy godmother, Tom Thumb endures a number of mishaps because of his size (he is swallowed three times) but survives to vanquish the fierce giant Gembo from the land. For this King Arthur knights him: "Sir Tom Thumb evermore the smallest and the boldest of the crown's protectors." Craft's renderings of architecture, dress and border art, inspired by 12th-century manuscripts and illustrations, capture both the grand and comic elements of the story. Scenes of a humiliated knight returning to the Round Table with the giant's bites taken out of his sword and shield or of Tom escaping down Gembo's mountainous shoulder will tickle the funny bones of many readers, while the diminutive fellow's reunion with his parents ends the volume on a note of happy recognition. Mayer's effort to form one coherent story out of a number of different episodes is not always smooth; still, this charming rendition does a nice job of introducing a classic character.

Arvid Jansen, thirty-seven, is trying to bridge the yawning gulf that opened up years earlier between himself and his mother. He is in the throes of a divorce, and she has just been diagnosed with cancer.</p><p>Over a few intense autumn days, Arvid struggles to find a new footing in his life. As he attempts to negotiate the present changes around him, he casts his mind back to holidays on the beach with his brothers, and to the early days of his courtship. Most importantly, he revisits the idealism of his communist youth, when he chose the factory floor over the college education his mother had struggled so hard to provide. Back then, Arvid's loyalty to his working-class background outweighed his mother's wish for him to escape it. </p><p>As Petterson's masterful narrative shifts effortlessly through the years, we see Arvid tentatively circling his mother, unable to tell her what she already knows he is thinking. In its piercing portrait of their layered relationship, <i>I Curse the River of Time</i> bears all the hallmarks of Petterson's compassion for humanity that has won him readers the world over.</p></p><p><p><b>Per Petterson</b> is the author of books including <i>In the Wake</i>, <i>To Siberia</i>, and <i>Out Stealing Horses</i>, which won the IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize and the Norwegian Booksellers' Prize. <i>The New York Times</i> Book Review named it one of the 10 best books of the year. A former bookseller, Petterson lives in Oslo, Norway.</p><b>1</b><br>All this happened quite a few years ago. My mother had been unwell for some time. To put a stop to my brothers&#x2019; nagging and my father&#x2019;s especially, she finally went to see the doctor she always saw, the doctor my family had used since the dawn of time. He must have been ancient at that point for I cannot recall ever <i>not </i>visiting him, nor can I recall him ever being young. I used him myself even though I now lived a good distance away.<br>&nbsp;<br>After a brief check-up, this old family doctor swiftly referred her to Aker Hospital for further examination. Having been for several, no doubt painful, tests in rooms painted white, painted apple green, at the big hospital near the Sinsen junction on the side of Oslo I always like to think of as <i>our </i>side, the east side that is, she was told to go home and wait two weeks for the results. When they finally arrived, three weeks later rather than two, it turned out that she had stomach cancer. Her first reaction was as follows: Good Lord, here I&#x2019;ve been lying awake night after night, year after year, especially when the children were small, terrified of dying from lung cancer, and then I get cancer of the stomach. What a waste of time!<br>&nbsp;<br>My mother was like that. And she was a smoker, just as I have been my entire adult life. I know well those night-time moments when you lie in bed staring into the dark, with dry, aching eyes feeling life like ashes in your mouth, even though I have probably worried more about my own life than leaving my children fatherless.<br>&nbsp;<br>For a while she just sat at the kitchen table with the envelope in her hand, staring out of the window at the same lawn, the same white painted fence, the same clothes lines and the same row of identical grey houses she had been looking at for so many years, and she realised she did not like it here at all. She did not like all the rock in this country, did not like the spruce forests or the high plains, did not like the mountains. She could not see the mountains, but she knew they were everywhere out there leaving their mark, every single day, on the people who lived in Norway.<br>&nbsp;<br>She stood up, went out into the hallway, made a call, replaced the receiver after a brief conversation and returned to the kitchen table to wait for my father. My father was retired and had been for some years, but she was fourteen years younger than him and still working; though today was her day off.<br>&nbsp;<br>My father was out, he always had something he needed to see to, errands to run my mother was rarely told about, the results of which she never saw, but whatever conflicts there had been between them were settled long ago. There was a truce now. As long as he did not try to run her life, he was left in peace to run his own. She had even started to defend and protect him. If I uttered a word of criticism or took her side in a misguided attempt to support the women&#x2019;s liberation, I was told to mind my own business. It is easy for you to criticise, she would say, who have had it all handed to you on a silver plate. You squirt.<br>&nbsp;<br>As if my own life were plain sailing. I was heading full speed for a divorce. It was my first; I thought it was the end of the world. There were days I could not move from the kitchen to the bathroom without falling to my knees at least once before I could pull myself together and walk on.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>When finally my father returned from whatever project he thought was the most urgent, something at V�lerenga no doubt, which was the place he was born, where I too had been born seven years after the end of the war, a place he often returned to, to meet up with men his own age and background, to see <i>the old boys</i>, as they called themselves, my mother was still sitting at the kitchen table. She was smoking a cigarette, a Salem, I guess, or perhaps a Cooly. If you were scared of lung cancer you ended up smoking menthols.<br>&nbsp;<br>My father stood in the doorway with a well-worn bag in his hand, not unlike the one I used in years six and seven at school, we all carried a bag like that then, and for all I know it was the same one. In that case the bag was more than twenty-five years old.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m leaving today,&#x2019; my mother said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Where to?&#x2019; my father said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Home.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Home,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Today? Shouldn&#x2019;t we talk about it first? Don&#x2019;t I get a chance to think about it?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;There&#x2019;s nothing to discuss,&#x2019; my mother said. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve booked my ticket. I&#x2019;ve just had a letter from Aker Hospital. I&#x2019;ve got cancer.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;You have cancer?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Yes. I&#x2019;ve got stomach cancer. So now I have to go home for a bit.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>She still referred to Denmark as <i>home </i>when she spoke about the town she came from, in the far north of that small country, even though she had lived in Norway, in Oslo, for forty years exactly.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;But, do you want to go alone?&#x2019; he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; my mother said. &#x2018;That&#x2019;s what I want.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>And when she said it like this she knew my father would be hurt and upset, and that gave her no pleasure at all, on the contrary, he deserves better, she thought, after so much life, but she did not feel she had a choice. She had to go on her own.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;I probably won&#x2019;t stay very long,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;Just a few days, and then I&#x2019;ll be back. I have to go into hospital. I may need an operation. At least I hope so. In any case I&#x2019;m catching the evening ferry.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>She looked at her watch.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;And that&#x2019;s in three hours. I&#x2019;d best go upstairs and pack my things.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>They lived in a terraced house with a kitchen and a living room on the ground floor and three small bedrooms and a tiny bathroom on the first. I grew up in that house. I knew every crinkle in the wallpaper, every crack in the floorboards, every terrifying corner in the cellar. It was cheap housing. If you kicked the wall hard enough, your foot would crash into your neighbour&#x2019;s living room.<br>&nbsp;<br>She stubbed out the cigarette in the ashtray and stood up. My father had not moved, he was still standing in the doorway with the bag in one hand, the other insecurely raised in her direction. He had never been a champ when it came to physical contact, not outside the boxing ring, and frankly, it was not her strong point either, but now she pushed my father aside, carefully, almost lovingly so that she could get past. And he let her do it, but with so much reluctance, both firm and slow, it was enough for her to understand he wanted to give her something tangible, a sign, without putting it into words. But it&#x2019;s too late for that, she told herself, far too late, she said, but he could not hear her. Yet she allowed my father to hold her up long enough for him to understand there was enough between them after forty years together and four sons, even though one of them had already died, for them to live in the same house still, in the same flat, and wait for each other and not just run off when something important had happened.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The ferry she was travelling on, which we all travelled on when we headed south, was called the <i>Holger Danske</i>. Later she was docked and turned into a shelter for refugees, in Stockholm first, I&#x2019;ve found out, and then in Malm�, and was now stripped down to scrap metal on some beach in Asia, in India or Bangladesh, but in the days I am talking about here, she still sailed between Oslo and this town in the far north of Jutland, the very town my mother grew up in.<br>&nbsp;<br>She liked that boat and thought its poor reputation was unfair; <i>Not a Chanske, </i>as she was popularly known, but it was a much better ship, she thought, than the floating casinos which sail the route today, where the opportunities for drinking yourself senseless have become senselessly many and even though the <i>Holger Danske </i>might have rolled a bit from side to side when the weather was bad, that did not mean she was about to go down the great drain. I have thrown up on board the <i>Holger Danske </i>myself and never gave it a thought.<br>&nbsp;<br>My mother was fond of the crew. With time she had made friends with many of them, for it was a small ship, and they knew who <i>she </i>was and greeted her as one of their own when she came up the gangway.<br>&nbsp;<br>Perhaps on this occasion they noticed a new gravity in her manner, in her walk, in the way she looked around her, as she often would with a smile on her lips that was <i>not </i>a smile as there was nothing to smile about that anyone could see, but it was how she looked when her mind was somewhere else and definitely not in a place that those around her could have guessed. I thought she looked especially pretty then. Her skin was smooth and her eyes took on a strange, clear shine. As a small boy I often sat watching her when she was not aware I was in the room or perhaps had forgotten I was there, and that could make me feel lonely and abandoned. But it was exciting, too, for she looked like a woman in a film on TV, like Greta Garbo in <i>Queen Christina </i>lost in thought at the ship&#x2019;s bow close to the end of the film on her way to some other more spiritual place, and yet somehow she had managed to enter our kitchen and stop there for a while to sit on one of the red kitchen chairs with a smoking cigarette between her fingers and a so far untouched and unsolved crossword open in front of her on the table. Or she might look like Ingrid Bergman in <i>Casablanca </i>as she had the same hairstyle and the same curve along her cheek, but my mother would never have said: <i>You have to think for both of us </i>to Humphrey Bogart. Not to anyone.<br>&nbsp;<br>If the crew of the <i>Holger Danske </i>had picked up on this or any other change in her way of greeting them when she crossed the gangway with her small brown suitcase of imitation leather, which is mine now and I still use wherever I go, there was no remark to that effect and I think she was grateful for that.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>When she had found her cabin, she placed the suitcase on a chair, took a glass from the shelf above the sink, cleaned it carefully before she opened the suitcase and pulled out a half-bottle from underneath her clothes. It was Upper Ten, her favourite brand of whisky when she drank the hard liquor, which she did, I think, more often than we were aware of. Not that it was any of our business, but my brothers considered Upper Ten to be cheap shit, at least when you had access to duty free goods. They preferred malt whisky, Glenfiddich, or Chivas Regal which was sold on the ferry to Denmark, and they would hold forth at length about the distinctive caress of the single malt on your palate and other such nonsense, and we mocked my mother for her poor taste. Then she would give us an icy stare and say:<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;And you are <i>my </i>sons? Snobs?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>And she would say: &#x2018;If you want to sin, it better sting.&#x2019; And the truth is that I agreed with her, and to be honest I, too, bought the Norwegian label Upper Ten the few times I mustered the courage to go to the wine monopoly, and Upper Ten was neither single malt nor mild on your palate; on the contrary, it made your throat burn and the tears well up in your eyes unless you were prepared for the first mouthful. This is not to say that it was <i>bad </i>whisky, only that it was cheap.<br>&nbsp;<br>My mother twisted the top off the bottle with a sudden movement and she filled the glass roughly three-quarters full, drained it in two gulps, and it burned her mouth and her throat so badly she had to cough, and then she cried a little too as she was already in pain. Then she put the bottle back under the clothes in her suitcase as if it were contraband she was carrying and the customs officers were at the door with their crowbars and handcuffs, and she washed her tears away in front of the mirror above the tap and dried her face and tugged at her clothes the way plump women nearly always do, before she went upstairs to the cafeteria which was a modest cafeteria in every sense of the word, and the menu was modest and manageable the way she liked it, and that made the <i>Holger Danske </i>the perfect boat.<br>&nbsp;<br>She brought with her the book she was reading, and she was always reading, always had a book tucked into her bag, and if G�nter Grass had published a novel recently, it was very likely the one she was carrying, in German. When I stopped reading books in German shortly after I left school for the simple reason I no longer had to, she dressed me down and told me I was intellectually lazy, and I defended myself and said I was not; it was a matter of principle, I said, because I hated the Nazis. That enraged her. She pointed a trembling index finger at my nose and said, what do you know about Germany and German history and what happened there? You squirt. She would often call me that. You squirt, she said, and it is true that I was not tall of stature, but then neither was she. But I was fit, I always have been, and the nickname &#x2018;squirt&#x2019; implied both meanings: that I was fairly short of stature, like she was, and at the same time fit, like my father was, and that perhaps she liked me that way. At least I hoped she did. So when she dressed me down and called me a squirt, I was never in serious trouble. And I did not know that much about Germany at the time of this conversation. She had a point.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I cannot imagine she craved company in the cafeteria on board the <i>Holger Danske </i>and approached a table to engage someone in conversation, to find out what their thoughts were and what their dreams, for they were of her kind and had the same background, or the opposite, because they were different too, and it is in the way we differ that you find what is interesting, what is possible, she believed, and she searched for those differences and got a great deal out of them. On this occasion she sat down, alone, at a table for two and ate in silence and concentrated on her book over coffee after her meal, and when her cup was empty she tucked the book under her arm and stood up. The very moment her body left the chair, she felt so exhausted she thought she would collapse there and then and never stand up again. She clung to the edge of the table, the world drifted like the ferry did, and she had no idea how she would manage to get through the cafeteria, past the reception and down the stairs. And yet she did. She took a deep breath and walked with quiet determination between the tables, down the stairs to the cabins, and she had the expression on her face which I have already described, and only a few times did she lean against the wall for support before she found her cabin door, pulled the key from her coat pocket, and locked the door behind her. The minute she sat down on her bed, she poured a large measure of Upper Ten into her glass and downed it in three quick gulps, and she cried when it hurt.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Manual of Indulgences</h2><p>This exclusive English-language translation of the Manual on Indulgences explains what indulgences are and provides the many devotional prayers associated with them.</p><p></p><h2>JR</h2><p>ABSURDLY LOGICAL,MERCILESSLY REAL,GATHERING ITS OWN TUMULTOUS MOMENTUM FOR THE ULTIMATE BRUSH WITH COMMODITY TRADING JR CAPTURES THE READER IN THE CACOPHONY OF VOICES THAT REVOLES AROUND THIS YOUNG CAPTIVE OF HIS OWN MYTHS.

Dubbed the "father" of all of the Park rats&#x2015;although he had no children of his own&#x2015;Sam was especially close to his niece, P. I. Kate Shugak.

Kate and the aunties had decided that the potlatch would be on the fifteenth of January, which gave them a little over three months to label Old Sam&#x2019;s possessions for the gift giving, and to allow everyone from Alaska and Outside who wanted to attend to make travel arrangements and contact friends and rela�tives in the Park for a place to unroll their sleeping bags. </p><p>It was also the day of the annual shareholder meeting of the Niniltna Native Association. The price of gas being what it was, travel to and from Niniltna was not cheap, no matter if you did it by plane, boat, pickup, four-wheeler, or snowgo. Plus, it cost the same to rent the high school gym for an event that lasted four hours as it did for an event that lasted all day. Kate Shugak was a frugal and practical woman. </p><p>There was a file marked &#x201c;Will&#x201d; in the back of the box. Kate pulled it out and opened it. </p><p>Jim looked at her bent head, and at Mutt, who was leaning up against Kate&#x2019;s side. Whenever Kate was hurting, Mutt was always as close to her as she could get without actually climbing into her lap. Since Mutt, the half gray wolf half husky who allowed Kate to live with her outweighed Kate by twenty pounds, leaning seemed the better option all around. </p><p>Old Sam&#x2019;s cabin was built on a floor plan common to the Park any�time between twenty-five and a hundred years before, a ground floor twenty- five feet square with a sleeping loft reached by a ladder made from two-by-fours. The rungs on the ladder were worn smooth from decades of use. Jim hoped that when he was eighty-nine his knees would be in good enough shape to climb eight feet up a vertical lad�der to get to bed. </p><p>He looked back at Kate. </p><p>If she were waiting for him in that bed, he&#x2019;d find a way. </p><p>The one room downstairs had a counter with an old chipped por�celain farm sink set into it, with shelves built into the wall above and below. The sink came with an old-fashioned swan-necked spout and two spoked faucets. Old Sam had tapped into public water when it had come into Niniltna twenty years before, but the out house was still outside. When asked why no indoor toilet, a growled &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t shit in your own nest&#x201d; was his invariable reply. </p><p>There was an oil stove for cooking and a woodstove for heat and an old Frigidaire refrigerator that must have been added when they ran the power line out from Ahtna back in the sixties. More built-in shelves covered every inch of the back wall from floor to ceiling beneath the floor of the loft, one section for weapons and ammunition and the rest for books ranging from Zane Grey to a leather-bound, three- volume edition of the log of Captain Cook that made Jim&#x2019;s mouth water just to look at it. A brown vinyl recliner with a dent in the seat the size of Old Sam&#x2019;s skinny ass occupied one corner, next to a pole lamp and a Blazo box standing on one end. The box was covered with mug rings and was filled with a stack of magazines, <i>National Geographic</i>, <i>Alaska</i><i> </i>magazine, <i>Playboy</i>. There was a workbench next to the door where Old Sam cleaned his guns and did the fine wood�working on projects he&#x2019;d allowed Park rats to talk him into, wall shelves and cupboards, mostly, with an occasional bed frame or din�ing table thrown in. </p><p>&#x201c;He revised his will only last month.&#x201d; </p><p>Kate was sitting at the chrome-legged dining table in the center of the room, on one of three mismatched chairs. The table had a lazy Susan in the middle of it, filled with salt and pepper shakers, a sugar bowl, a Darigold one-pound butter can with a plastic lid, a bottle of soy sauce. Old Sam liked his sticky rice, a legacy of his half-Filipino father. </p><p>Had liked. It was still difficult to accept the fact that the old man was dead. It was especially difficult to imagine life in the Park going on without his acid, perspicacious, and occasionally uncomfortably prophetic commentary. Old Sam had been an entire Greek chorus all by himself. </p><p>&#x201c;He had a lot of stuff,&#x201d; Jim said. &#x201c;Do you want help?&#x201d; It was Monday morning, and he was past due at work. </p><p>She looked up. &#x201c;Less than two weeks ago.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;He revised his will less than two weeks ago.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Maybe he had a premonition.&#x201d; </p><p>She snorted. &#x201c;There was never anything the least bit fey about Old Sam.&#x201d; </p><p>Jim thought of the old man built of bone and sinew, quick, smart, smart-assed. Indomitable, indestructible, and until the day before yesterday, immortal. Kate was right. If anyone had ever lived in the real world, it had been Old Sam Dementieff. Jim was going to miss the hell out of him. &#x201c;Do you need help here?&#x201d; he asked again. &#x201c;I can take a day.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, but I got this.&#x201d; She tucked a strand of short dark hair behind an ear, exposing the high, flat cheekbone and the strong throat bisected by the long scar that had faded over the last eight years to a thin white line. With hazel eyes set in skin darkened to bronze by the summer just past and a full seductive mouth set over an obstinate chin, she was a five- foot, one- hundred- and- twenty- pound package of dynamite clad in black sweatshirt, blue jeans, and tennis shoes. </p><p>His dynamite. The pronoun came to him without warning, and under its influence he stepped forward to pull the file from her hands. &#x201c;Come here.&#x201d; He picked her up and sat down again on the chair, set�ting her on his lap. </p><p>She didn&#x2019;t protest. Her head found a place on his shoulder instead, and a moment later he felt the warmth of her tears soak through his shirt. </p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; he said, tipping her head up. </p><p>She took a shaky breath and tried to smile. &#x201c;He&#x2019;d make fun of me if he could see me now.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Bullshit,&#x201d; Jim said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;d be proud you cared enough. Listen, Kate. He went out the way we all wish we could go. He hunted his own moose, packed it home, butchered it out, and threw a feed for everyone he loved. Damn fine feed, too.&#x201d; </p><p>Her smile was wobbly. &#x201c;Yeah, it was.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And then he turned off the engine and left the shop.&#x201d; Jim&#x2019;s shoul�ders rose and fell in a slight shrug. &#x201c;What do you Injuns say? It was a good day to die.&#x201d; </p><p>She sniffed and gulped back a laugh that was half sob. </p><p>He leaned in, his lips moving across her skin, sipping at the salt tears. Her breath caught, warm on his cheek, and her head turned so her mouth was close to his. He accepted the invitation and their lips met in a long and gentle caress, his hands warm and strong at the back of her neck and on her hip. </p><p>It was becoming less frightening to him, this need he found to comfort, to console, to demonstrate an affection that had nothing to do with sex. Although if the nearest bed hadn&#x2019;t belonged to a man not dead forty-eight hours . . . He raised his head and hazel eyes met blue in a long look. &#x201c;Better?&#x201d; </p><p>She was a little flushed, and the full lips quirked at the corners. &#x201c;An effective laying on of healing hands.&#x201d; </p><p>He grinned and kissed her again, quick and hard. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll lay more than that later.&#x201d; </p><p>She laughed. </p><p>Old Sam would have, too. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The loss of Old Sam Dementieff notwithstanding, Jim drove to the trooper post with a lighter heart. Probably part of that was due to Kate&#x2019;s being as willing to accept his comfort as he was unafraid to give it. They&#x2019;d been circling each other for so long, wary, suspicious, and let&#x2019;s face it, just plain scared of all the baggage loaded on that slow-moving barge called relationship. You couldn&#x2019;t move a barge on its own, you had to hire a tug. Up until Kate, the women with whom he&#x2019;d kept company had lasted the length of a ride in a cigarette boat between Miami and Havana. Sometimes it felt like he&#x2019;d served more time for Kate than Jacob had for Rachel. </p><p>He knew she was still working out the trust issues. Jack Morgan, a government-certified Grade A one-woman man, was a hard act to follow in that respect. It didn&#x2019;t help that despite a visible lack of off�spring, Chopper Jim Chopin&#x2019;s <i>nom d&#x2019;amour</i> had once been Father of the Park. Come to think of it, Old Sam had been the one to hang that on him. Right after Misty Lambert had burned the clothes he&#x2019;d left behind, during the monthly meeting of her book club with all eight members in attendance and more invited over to celebrate the event. At least half of whom he&#x2019;d slept with at one time or an�other. </p><p>They&#x2019;d all got a big laugh out of it at the time, both the ritual im�molation and Old Sam&#x2019;s nicknaming, but the truth was, Jim Chopin was probably quicker with a condom than he was with his sidearm. Living with Johnny Morgan was as close as he ever wanted to come to being a father. As the only Alaska state trooper in twenty million acres of national Park, he already had eight thousand children re�quiring primary care. </p><p>He pulled up in front of the post, making a mental note to stop in at the high school to suggest to Johnny, man-to-man, that he spend the night in town. Johnny was old enough to recognize the justice of the appeal, and besides, given the way things appeared to be heating up between Johnny and Van, the kid would expect some reciprocity in the not too distant future. Jim had a vivid memory of what sixteen was like. If he couldn&#x2019;t keep his hands off Kate now, at sixteen he would have kept her horizontal for days at a time. </p><p>He laughed at himself and got out of the truck. His dispatcher met him at the door, a pink message slip in hand and an expression on her face that wiped his mind free of blithe spirit. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; he said, mind racing, sorting through the usual suspects. Howie Katel�nikof, Martin Shugak, Wade Roche and what might or might not be going on out at his place, Dulcey Kineen&#x2019;s latest escapade, which he hoped this time did not involve the road grader. &#x201c;Cindy threatening to shoot Willard again?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;No, Jim,&#x201d; she said, and right away he knew from the gentleness of her reply that it was going to be bad. &#x201c;I just got off the satellite phone with Nick.&#x201d; </p><p>Nick Luther was head of the Alaska state trooper detachment in Tok, which had been Jim&#x2019;s old post until two years before, when volume of business caused Juneau to open a new trooper post in the Park. He wondered now why he had never wondered before if some�one in the state capital had known about the discovery of the world&#x2019;s second largest gold mine in Suulutaq before making that decision. </p><p>His mind tended to head off on tangents whenever he wanted to avoid what was coming at him like a steamroller. He took a deep breath. &#x201c;Go ahead,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Serve it up.&#x201d; When she still hesitated, he said, &#x201c;What ever it is, letting it sit won&#x2019;t make it smell any better.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no easy way to say this, Jim,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Your mother called.&#x201d; </p><p>His spine stiffened. &#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry. Your father died.&#x201d; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kate sat on the bed and watched him pack, putting clothes she had never seen him wear into an actual suitcase she&#x2019;d never seen him use. Out of uniform he wore T-shirts and jeans. Traveling within Alaska he used a pack. The charcoal gray suit looked like something the new and improved Kurt Pletnikof would wear to meet his better- heeled clients in Anchorage. The silver, hard- sided suitcase looked like it had been bought out of the SkyMall catalogue, with which Kate was familiar only because it was in every seat pocket on every Alaska Airlines 737, offering everything from basketballs autographed by Magic Johnson to $900 wine fridges, none of which was much use to anyone about to make a connecting flight to Igiugig. &#x201c;Gee,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;looks just like downtown.&#x201d; </p><p>He shot her a quick look, and she wondered if that had come out more intimidated that she had meant it to. &#x201c;California, here I come,&#x201d; he said. </p><p>Try as she might she could not detect any joy in his tone. </p><p>They were in his room at Auntie Vi&#x2019;s B and B, or what had been Auntie Vi&#x2019;s B and B before she sold it to the owners of the Suulutaq Mine to be a bunkhouse for mine employees in transit. Auntie Vi was now running it for them. A condition of sale had been that Jim got to keep his room there, which he had had since first moving to the Park to open the post. Mine manager Vern Truax had been more than happy to accommodate a law enforcement presence fifty miles from his mine. </p><p>&#x201c;Right back where you started from,&#x201d; Kate said. </p><p>This time he stood up and looked her straight in the eye. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t be staying long.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have any brothers or sisters,&#x201d; she said. </p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And your mother is how old?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Seventy- nine.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Ten years younger than Old Sam.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; </p><p>She thought of how healthy Old Sam had been, right up until he sat down on his dock and died. &#x201c;Your mom in good shape?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Depends on what you mean by &#x2018;in good shape.&#x2019; I&#x2019;d bet a whole paycheck she looks pretty damn good. She&#x2019;d sure as hell spend it getting that way.&#x201d; He zipped the suit into a garment bag, something else Kate recognized only from cata logues, and snapped it into the lid of the aluminum suitcase. </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re, what, forty-two now?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;She was thirty- seven when you were born.&#x201d; </p><p>He added a couple of white, button-down shirts, neatly folded, to the suitcase. T-shirts, shorts, and socks followed. &#x201c;I showed up late, when they&#x2019;d pretty much given up on having kids. Dad was forty-five.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You never talk about them.&#x201d; </p><p>He shrugged. &#x201c;Not much to say. They were hard of hearing before I was in high school. It was like growing up with grandparents.&#x201d; </p><p>Wow, she thought. Didn&#x2019;t that sound affectionate. </p><p>When she thought about it later, she wondered if that lack of affection might have been part of what had driven Jim north in the first place. </p><p>He pulled a shoebox from beneath the bed and added it to the suit�case. The ditty bag full of toiletries went into a daypack with Craig Johnson&#x2019;s latest Walt Longmire novel and Naomi Novik&#x2019;s <i>Victory of Eagles</i>. The books had been waiting for him in the post office when he had cleaned out his mailbox that morning. He hoped two books&nbsp; were enough to get him from Anchorage to San Jose, because the rest of his to-read pile was back at Kate&#x2019;s&nbsp; house. He was six four, and there was nothing worse than being shoehorned into last class with nothing to take his mind off the discomfort of having his knees jammed up against the seat in front of him. He&#x2019;d once been stuck on a flight from Phoenix to Seattle with a Steve Martini book whose perp he&#x2019;d guessed before they reached cruising altitude. Never again. &#x201c;Where the hell&#x2019;s my&#x2014; Oh, here it is,&#x201d; he said, producing a clip-on reading light and tossing it into the daypack with the books. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve got the seats so close together on the new jets that I can never get the overhead light to shine on anything but the top of the head of the guy sitting in front of me. Especially when he leans his chair back into my lap.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Jim?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Why did you come to Alaska?&#x201d; </p><p>He zipped up the daypack. &#x201c;I read <i>Coming into the Country</i> when I was too young to resist.&#x201d; </p><p>Always with the smart remark. Fine. &#x201c;Is anyone coming in to the country to cover for you while you&#x2019;re gone?&#x201d; </p><p>He snapped...</p></p><h2>Prisoners of Hope: The Story of Our Captivity and Freedom in Afghanistan</h2><p><b>The gripping and inspiring story of two extraordinary women--from their imprisonment by the Taliban to their rescue by U.S. Special Forces. <br></b><br>When Dayna Curry and Heather Mercer arrived in Afghanistan, they had come to help bring a better life and a little hope to some of the poorest and most oppressed people in the world. Within a few months, their lives were thrown into chaos as they became pawns in historic international events. They were arrested by the ruling Taliban government for teaching about Christianity to the people with whom they worked. In the middle of their trial, the events of September 11, 2001, led to the international war on terrorism, with the Taliban a primary target. While many feared Curry and Mercer could not survive in the midst of war, Americans nonetheless prayed for their safe return, and in November their prayers were answered.<br><br>In <i>Prisoners of Hope</i>, Dayna Curry and Heather Mercer tell the story of their work in Afghanistan, their love for the people they served, their arrest, trial, and imprisonment by the Taliban, and their rescue by U.S. Special Forces. The heart of the book will discuss how two middle-class American women decided to leave the comforts of home in exchange for the opportunity to serve the disadvantaged, and how their faith motivated them and sustained them through the events that followed. Their story is a magnificent narrative of ordinary women caught in extraordinary circumstances as a result of their commitment to serve the poorest and most oppressed women and children in the world. This book will be inspiring to those who seek a purpose greater than themselves.</p><p>"Heather Mercer and Dayna Curry decided to go to help people who needed help. Their faith led them to Afghanistan. One woman who knows them best put it this way: they had a calling to serve the poorest of the poor, and Afghanistan is where that calling took them. And Heather and Dayna's faith in God sustained them throughout their ordeal. It's a wonderful story about prayer, about a faith that can sustain people in good times and in bad times. Their faith was a source of hope that kept them from becoming discouraged. I talked to them right after their release, their freedom, and I sensed no bitterness in their voice, no fatigue, just joy. It was an uplifting experience for me to talk to these courageous souls." &#x2013;President George W.

His new book takes up where the previous work left off. Examining the question of what to eat from the perspective of health, this powerfully argued, thoroughly researched and elegant manifesto cuts straight to the chase with a maxim that is deceptively simple: &#39;Eat food, not too much, mostly plants.&#39; But as Pollan explains, &#39;food&#39; in a country that is driven by &#39;a thirty-two billion-dollar marketing machine&#39; is both a loaded term and, in its purest sense, a holy grail. The first section of his three-part essay refutes the authority of the diet bullies, pointing up the confluence of interests among manufacturers of processed foods, marketers and nutritional scientists - a cabal whose nutritional advice has given rise to &#39;a notably unhealthy preoccupation with nutrition and diet and the idea of eating healthily.&#39; The second portion vivisects the Western diet, questioning, among other sacred cows, the idea that dietary fat leads to chronic illness. A writer of great subtlety, Pollan doesn&#39;t preach to the choir; in fact, rarely does he preach at all, preferring to lets the facts speak for themselves.&#34; Publishers Weekly (Starred Review) (Copyright Reed Business Information, Inc.)</p><p></p><h2>In The Wilds: Drawings by Nigel Peake</h2><p><em>In the Wilds</em> is a collection of artist Nigel Peake's hand-drawn observations of rural life.

Shrink-wrapped stock.<br><br>"What drives me to continue this work is difficult to name. It has more to do with love than with sociology. With being a subject in the drama rather than a witness. And in the odd and jumbled process of working, everything shifts: the boundaries blur, my distance slips, the arrogance and illusion of immunity falter. I wake up in the middle of the night, stunned and anguished. These are my parents. From that simple fact, everything follows.' Larry Sultan.<br><br>First published in 1992 to wide critical acclaim, Pictures From Home is Larry Sultan's pendant to his parents. Sultan returned home to Southern California periodically in the 1980s and the decade-long sequence moves between registers, combining contemporary photographs with film stills from home movies, fragments of conversation, Sultan's own writings and other memorabilia. The result is a narrative collage in which the boundary between the documentary and the staged becomes increasingly ambiguous. Simultaneously the distance usually maintained between the photographer and his subjects also slips in an exchange of dialogue and emotion that is unique to this work. Significantly increasing the page count of the original book, this MACK design of Pictures From Home clarifies the multiplicity of voices - both textual and pictorial - in order to afford a fresh perspective of this seminal body of work.<br><br>Emphasising the cinematic motion of the family's home videos, the Super-8 film stills have been newly digitised and magnified, with select scenes running full-bleed across double-page spreads. Meanwhile, Sultan's photographs of his parents as they go about their daily lives - against the quintessential backdrop of the Reagan-era American dream - are supplemented with previously unpublished images. Most significantly, the book honours Sultan as the oft-hailed 'King of Colour Photography'.</p><p></p><h2>The Hebrides (New Naturalist Series)</h2><p>Starting with an explanation of the geology, climate and hydrography and soils of the Hebridean Islands, the authors move on to a description of the many different habitats, from the sea and inland waters to woodlands and moors and hills.

As Oscar Wilde is purported to have said, &#34;Life is too important to be taken seriously.&#34;Someone is strangling novice nuns in Jackson's terrifying if overwrought seventh Bentz and Montoya novel (after Malice). When NOPD homicide detectives Reuben Montoya and Rick Bentz arrive at the first crime scene, the chapel of St. Marguerite's Convent, Montoya recognizes the murder victim, Sister Camille, as his old high school girlfriend, Cammie Renard. In another coincidence, the novice sister who discovered Camille's body, Lucia Costa, once dated Montoya's brother. On top of that, one of the prime suspects is a high school classmate of Montoya's, Fr. Francis O'Toole, who may have had an affair with the victim. As Cammie's sister, Valerie, a former Texas cop now a New Orleans Garden District B&amp;B owner, struggles with a surprise visit from her estranged husband, more nuns succumb to a crazed killer. Val learns more than she bargained for about her past&#x2014;and Cammie's&#x2014;at a nearby orphanage in a creepy thriller sure to please Jackson's many fans. (Apr.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Even outside of Christianity he continues to appeal to people. And yet for so many, the popular Jesus is not the Jesus of Christianity. The popular Jesus makes no demands and never challenges people. He accepts everyone and everything under all circumstances.<p> <i>On the Way to Jesus Christ</i> is a series of meditations that Pope Benedict XVI wrote while he was Prefect for the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith. The true Jesus, he writes, is the Jesus of the Gospels, who "is quite different, demanding, bold. The Jesus who makes everything OK for everyone is a phantom, a dream, not a real figure. The Jesus of the Gospels is certainly not convenient for us. But it is precisely in this way that he answers the deepest question of our existence, which--whether we want to or not--keeps us on the lookout for God, for a gratification that is limitless, for the infinite. We must again set out on the way to this real Jesus."</p><p> This book also examines whether Jesus Christ is the only savior, and the Church's responsibility to evangelize. It concludes with reflections on Jesus' Presence in the Holy Eucharist, and the Catechism of the Catholic Church's presentation of the Christian mystery as seen through the Catechism's dynamic view of Sacred Scripture.</p><p> <i>On the Way to Jesus Christ</i> is for anyone--believer or unbeliever-who wants better to understand the true Jesus, the Jesus of the Gospels, the Christ of Christianity.</p><p> <b>"Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, has written a brief but compelling invitation to know Jesus Christ as He really is: bold, demanding, merciful, strong, and the answer to our deepest longings. This is a must-read book for anyone serious about deepening his or her faith."<br><br> &#x2014;Charles J. Chaput, O.F.M. Cap., <i></i></b><i>Archbishop of Denver</i><br><br></p></p><p>Pope Benedict XVI is widely recognized as one of the most brilliant theologians and spiritual writers of our age. He has written many acclaimed spiritual and theological works that cover a broad range of important topics for modern man.The writings in this book precede Ratzinger's reign as Pope Benedict XVI and reflect his long teaching career, which included 24 years as prefect of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith under John Paul II. The papers in <i>On the Way to Jesus Christ</i> deal with following Christ on a variety of fronts. The initial three pieces concern discerning Christ in the text of the Bible, in liturgical imagery and iconography, and in the processes of evangelization. The next four address the figure of Christ in history and the church, as reflected by his responses to Satan's temptations, and present in the Eucharist and the community of its partakers; as perspicacious as they are learned, they are about as limpidly expressed as such careful exegesis could be. Of the closing two pieces, "Universality and Catholicity" instructively and even provocatively contrasts those terms in the context of the church, and the other answers criticisms of the Vatican II-inspired 1992 <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i> for being insufficiently modern. If none of this is easy reading, neither is it obscure or clotted with citational apparatus. Serious Christians stand to learn and relearn much from it. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Ansky, the influential Jewish-Russian journalist, playwright, and politician, received a commission: to organize desperately needed relief for Jews on the borderlands, who were caught between the warring armies of Russia, Germany, and the Austrian Empire. Thus began an extraordinary four-year journey meticulously documented by Ansky, a peerless witness of his time.<br><br>In daily accounts, Ansky details his struggles: to raise funds; to lobby and bribe at the tsar's court; to procure and transport food, medicine, and money to the ravaged Jewish towns, which, in the course of the war, were conquered and reconquered by Cossacks, Germans, Polish mercenaries, and Russian revolutionaries. Ansky depicts scenes of devastation-convoys of refugees, towns looted and burned to the ground, villagers taken hostage and raped, prey to all comers. Speaking to maids and ministers, farmers and recruits, doctors and profiteers, Ansky hears and sees it all, as the tsar's army disintegrates and the winds of revolution sweep across the land.<br><br>A wide-ranging view of a world at war, <i>The Enemy at His Pleasure</i> is at once powerful and poignant, a rare and invaluable addition to the historical record.<br></p><p><b>S.

The place was well away from the eyes and ears of the Gaelic court there, and thus suited to covert exchange. The information to be passed was dangerous; in the wrong hands it could be deadly. The future of kingdoms depended on it."What do you have for me?" There was a pattern to such exchanges; the younger man, a lean, dark individual with a shuttered expression, fell into it with the ease of long practice."A name," said the other, a tall fellow clad in the russet tunic of King Gabhran's household retainers. "Bridei must move quickly and cleverly if he is not to be hemmed in from north and south.""Spare me the analysis," the dark man said. "What name?""And in return?"The dark man's lips tightened. "You'll get your information."In the little silence that followed, the tall man glanced to left and to right along the shadowy way. All was quiet; moonlight, slanting in from the distant entry, allowed the two to read each other's features dimly. Under such a light it can be difficult to know if a man lies or tells the truth; itis hard to tell how far to trust. Both of these men were expert in such judgments, for a spy's existence is all calculated risk."One of the Caitt chieftains," whispered the tall man. "Alpin of Briar Wood. He commands an extensive personal army. The alliance could be sealed before next spring unless your people act to forestall it."The dark man nodded. "Which of the other northern chieftains would support him? Umbrig?""In my judgment, no. But they are kinsmen. Alpin has a natural son fostered in Umbrig's household. As for the others, I can't say. The chieftain of Briar Wood has both allies and enemies among his own.""I see.""Your king would be well advised to make a speedy approach to Alpin," said the tall man. "You'd best have a quiet word in Bridei's ear."The dark man's expression did not change. "I'm hardly in a position to do that," he said levelly. "I'm only a bearer of information. I'm not the king's confidant.""That's not what I've heard.""Then you've been misinformed," the dark man said."Now give me what you have."The dark man's eyes had grown colder. "Gabhran should look to his eastern defenses," he said. "Should this matter of the Caitt not impede him, Bridei could be ready to make his major push against the Gaels next spring. There's a council planned for Gathering, with high hopes Drust the Boar will fall in behind Bridei at last"The tall man grunted acceptance. The exchange of information was fair. What each man did with it was his own business.The two parted without farewells. The dark man had a long way to go; the tall man was closer to home, and he walked back along the shadowy passageway and out under cover of trees with his mind on supper and a warm night in the bed of a certain accommodating woman.A boy out fishing found him a few days later, his body swollen and distorted from immersion in a stream andbruised by the rocks under which it lay partly wedged. It was just possible to ascertain that he had not died from drowning, but had been expertly strangled by something strong and thin, such as a harp string.As for the dark man, by then he was long gone from Dunadd, headed back across the border out of the Gaelic territory of Dalriada and into the lands of King Bridei of the Priteni. The bag of silver he had received from his Dalriadan masters had been hidden away. There would be another payment when he got to Bridei's fortress at White Hill. Considerable wealth now lay in his secret place, a resource he would surely never use, since he had neither wife nor children, brother nor sister to spend it on; at least, none he was prepared to acknowledge, even to himself.He traveled with the speed and efficiency of a man who does not allow anything to distract him from his goal. It was unfortunate that his contact had required removal, but not unexpected. Pedar had not been stupid, and Faolan had known he would start to ferret out the truth about his own close relationship with Bridei eventually. He'd let his informant live until the danger of exposure was no longer outweighed by the value of what Pedar was able to supply. It was necessary that his Dalriadan masters believe Faolan entirely loyal to their cause. One must hope Pedar had kept faith with the delicate codes of covert intelligence, and had not shared his suspicions with anyone. At any rate, Faolan would need to stay clear of Dunadd a while, just to be sure. Perhaps Bridei would dispatch him to serve with Carnach's fighting men, preparing for the great war to come. Perhaps he might be assigned to Raven's Well, where another army readied itself for the final push westward into Dalriada. A little honest fighting would not be unwelcome. He had been dancing on the fringes of kings' courts for too long now, and was growing weary of masks. Ah, well; good speed, clement weather, and he should be back at White Hill before the moon reached full again. Perhaps, Faolan mused as he made his way up the track by the lake's edge, heading northeastward under the clear skies of a crisp spring day, he might simply return to his old roleas personal guard. In the five years since Bridei was elected to the throne in somewhat unusual circumstances, nobody had got close enough to lay a finger on him or his wife. Faolan had made sure of that. Whenever he went away, he installed an infallible system of deputies to cover the period of his absence. All the same, nothing was quite as effective as his own presence by Bridei's side. He found, to his surprise, that this felt almost like going home.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>ANA HAD BEEN a hostage at the court of Fortriu since she was ten and a half. After eight years, she recognized that what had once seemed a kind of prison, albeit one where the captive ate at the king's table and slept in fine linen and soft wool, had become more like a home. When Bridei built his new fortress at White Hill and moved the court of Fortriu, Ana moved with the rest of them. Bridei's wife, Tuala, was one of her closest friends. That, thought Ana as she guided the tiny, tottering figure of the king's son Derelei across the sheltered garden that lay within the fortress walls, presented a problem for Bridei. The whole point of taking hostages was leverage against their kinsfolk. She was here as surety against a possible revolt by her cousin, who was monarch of the Light Isles and a vassal king to Bridei. In those eight years, there had been no sign of unrest in her home islands, so it seemed her captivity had had the desired effect. On the other hand, there had been little interest shown by those at home in her welfare; her family seemed to have forgotten her. These days, it was White Hill that felt like home, and she could not imagine Bridei hurting her in any way, should her kinsmen suddenly take against him."Oops!" Ana exclaimed as Derelei's infant knees gave way and he collapsed abruptly onto his well-padded posterior. He looked momentarily surprised, seemed to ponder whether crying might be in order, then reached his arms toward her, offering a sound that meant "Up!""Come on, then." Ana lifted the child to her hip; he wassmall for his age and had something of his mother's fey looks, the skin pale as milk, the eyes wide and solemn. His hair was Bridei's, brown as a nut and already curling tightly.Who would have thought it, back in the Banmerren days when they were students together? Tuala was married and a mother, and Ana was still here in Fortriu, unwed. Carrying the royal blood of Fortriu often felt more like a curse than a privilege, especially if one were a woman. In the lands of the Priteni, the royal descent came through the female line: kings were selected, not from kings' sons, but from the sons of women like Ana, those descended from an unbroken line of royal females. It made her a prize piece in the great game of political strategy. Whoever wed her could be the father of kings. Bridei, as king of Fortriu, would be the one who eventually made the decision as to where she would go and when. There might be a token consultation with her cousin, but with both her parents long dead, and her kin far away in the islands, she knew it would be Bridei's choice. When she was a little girl with a head full of stories, she had hoped for love. She knew now how foolish it was to expect that.And yet, for some people, love could be everything. Look at Bridei and Tuala. Their marriage had seemed impossible. It had been frowned upon by the powerful Broichan, the king's druid and Bridei's foster father. Ana looked down at Derelei, who had a strand of her long hair clutched in his fist and was exercising his new teeth on it. He gazed back, eyes solemn as an owl's. He was his mother's son, all right; the legacy of the Otherworld was plain in the tiny face, the delicate hands, the unusual gravity. Bridei had done the unthinkable; he had married for love, and as a result, Fortriu now had one of the Good Folk as its queen. Ana smiled to herself. A fine queen Tuala was, strong, courageous, and wise. People had accepted her for all her difference, and her husband loved her with a devotion that was plain every time he set eyes on her. Nonetheless, Bridei was king, and conducted his business in a realm of powerful and dangerous men. When it cameto it, Ana was just another useful piece in the game, kept in reserve for the moment when she might be deployed to best advantage."Mama!" Derelei stated with emphasis, releasing Ana's hair and turning his head toward the archway at the far end of the garden. It was a sunny spring day; the light touched the creeper that twined up the stone wall, making a pattern in shades of subtle green. There was no sign of anyone; no sound save t...</p><h2>A Last Goodbye</h2><p><i>New York Times </i>bestselling author J.A.

His dramatic paintings depicted catastrophe, war, apocalypse, and nature on an epic scale and appealed to a wider and more diverse audience than had ever previously been engaged by art. These works continue to reverberate, having long influenced Hollywood directors, science fiction writers, and other artists. Martin was one of the first artists to exploit the possibilities offered by printed reproductions; Engravings of his paintings were widely available and hugely popular, shocking the art establishment of his day. This first comprehensive book on Martin in many years examines the critic&#x2019;s idea of the proper role of the artist, questioning Martin&#x2019;s place in art history as well as our own ideas of &#x201c;good&#x201d; and &#x201c;bad&#x201d; taste, &#x201c;high&#x201d; and &#x201c;low&#x201d; art.</p></p><p><p><b>Martin Myrone </b>is curator of 18th &amp; 19th Century British Art at Tate Britain and the author of <i>The Blake Book </i>and <i>Henry Fuseli</i>.</p></p><h2>Growing Patterns Fibonacci Numbers in Nature</h2><p>This title deals with the biggest mathematical mystery in nature - Fibonacci numbers!

Young readers will soon be seeing nature through new eyes, looking for Fibonacci numbers in daisies, pinecones, leaf patterns, seashells, and more.</p><p></p><h2>Strangers: Homosexual Love in the Nineteenth Century</h2><p>A fresh examination of the development of homosexual culture during the nineteenth century in Europe and America describes the lives of gay men and women, how they discovered their sexuality, how they made contact with like-minded people, the relationship of gay culture to religion, and how homosexuals were treated by society. 30,000 first printing.</p><p>Each of <b>Graham Robb</b>'s three most recent books have been chosen as <i>New York Times</i> Editor's Choices for best books of the year. He lives in Oxford, England.With an impressive oeuvre comprising acclaimed biographies of Rimbaud, Balzac and Victor Hugo, Robb returns to spoof the poststructuralist convention that homosexuality, because it was not then categorized or "named," cannot be said to exist prior to 1880; he also argues that homosexual men and women in this period were not automatically persecuted. For Robb, Oscar Wilde's "martyrdom" and similar cases were exceptions to the rule of, if not acceptance, then a grudging knowing. He unpacks now obscure layers of contemporary allusion to show evidence of gay tolerance in many kinds of literary work, from high to low, from Continental, U.S. and U.K. fiction to the most obscure, nearly unreadable pamphlet. And some of the material is decidedly and hilariously antiliterary. "In Weiberbeute by `Luz Frauman' (Budapest, 1901), a frustrated lesbian hypnotizes her girlish stepson into thinking himself a woman. She then induces a phantom pregnancy in him, fosters her own son on him and convinces him he has given birth to a girl." Still, Robb's claim that the eponymous castle in Eekhoud's 1899 novel Escal-Vigor is a "partial anagram of Oscar Wilde" seems true only in the sense that it's also a partial anagram of Gore Vidal. The book ends fittingly on an extended inquiry into the mystery of why so many fictional detectives, beginning with the 19th-century Dupin and Sherlock Holmes, but also the 20th-century Miss Marple and Nero Wolfe, seem to be telling us today they're gay. This agreeable, provocative romp shows that, at least in some strata of society, their peers already knew. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Testimony of Light</h2><p>This moving story, based on the communications Helen Greaves received telepathically from her deceased friend, is an inspiring testament to the enduring power of their friendship.</p><p>Charles William Daniel (1871-1955) was a maverick free-thinker whose tiny publishing house had august links with many of the most influential thinkers and movements of the 20th century. To wit, copies of Daniel&#39;s books could be found in the library at Ghandi&#39;s ashram. This spirit lived on after his death, and the company maintained its niche by publishing definitive texts on a variety of spiritual and esoteric subjects. Many of these titles, notably those on Aromatherapy and Bach Flower remedies, have become standard works on the subject. When the C.W.

Mr. Badnarik starts with fundamentals, identifying the difference between rights and privileges. He discusses the critical- and needed- distinction between republican and democratic systems of government, arguing that freedom can survive in America only if we return to our republican roots. He also illustrates the forgotten tenets of federalism and states&#39; rights, arguing that federal usurpation of state power has accelerated the loss of our freedoms. The author then provides a detailed explication of the true meaning of major constitutional provisions and amendments.He does an excellent job of demystifying our founding document, demonstrating that ordinary Americans can and should understand the Constitution and how it applies to their lives.</p><p>Michael was born in Hammond, Indiana, and attended Indiana University in Bloomington.

Perhaps it was even your cousin or your next-door neighbor. There is a chance--a very good one--that sometime in the next few years you will actually come face to face with a giant hair-covered humanoid or a little man with bulging eyes, surrounded by a ghostly greenish glow.<br>An almost infinite variety of known and unknown creatures thrive on this mudball and appear regularly year after year, century after century. Uncounted millions of people have been terrified by their unexpected appearances in isolated forests, deserted highways, and even in the quiet back streets of heavily populated cities. Whole counties have been seized by "monster mania," with every available man joining armed posses to beat the bushes in search for the unbelievable somethings that have killed herds of cows and slaughtered dogs and horses.<br>Over the past hundred years, thousands of intriguing human interest items have appeared in newspapers all over the world, describing incredible encounters with awesome creatures unknown to science. Can <i>all</i> these items be hoaxes and journalistic jokes? Can we believe that the major wire services, whose very existence depends on their reliability, employ men to concoct and circulate irresponsible tales about hairy giants and helmeted pygmies stepping from circular flying machines? Can we conclude that the millions of badly frightened people who have reported such encounters to the local police and authorities are merely pathological liars and lunatics?<br>We know that our little planet is infested with remarkable animals and insects that defy common sense. Have you ever considered the total absurdity of the giraffe? Or that inane rodent, the lemming, swarms of which periodically march across miles of ice in the Arctic to drown themselves in the sea?<br>Scientists had a good laugh in 1856, when Paul du Chaillu returned from the Congo and described his encounter with a hairy giant. "He stood about a dozen yards from us, and was a sight I think I shall never forget," Du Chaillu reported. "Nearly six feet high, with immense body, huge chest, and great muscular arms, with fiercely glaring large deep gray eyes...he stood there and beat his breast with his huge fists till it resounded like an immense bass drum."<br>&nbsp;We know now that Du Chaillu was the first white man to meet a gorilla in Africa. Gorillas did not exist in 1856 simply because the desk-bound scientists of London and Paris said they did not exist.<br>People are still seeing things that do not exist scientifically. They are seeing them in Nebraska, in England, in Siberia, in South East Asia, and in national parks everywhere.<br>A Reuters dispatch from Malaysia on August 15, 1966, reported that an ape twenty-five feet tall was on the loose. Residents of the little village of Segamat were quoted in the <i>Malay Mail</i> as describing a shy, harmless giant who blundered about in the bushes, leaving huge eighteen-inch footprints in his wake. The report speculated that perhaps the giant ape was on the move because of the pressure of advancing civilization and the loss of feeding grounds.<br>An ape twenty-five feet tall is a biological impossibility. But that does not mean that one cannot exist.<br>Berwick, Nova Scotia, sounds exotic and faraway. Actually it is on the Canadian peninsula lying just off the coast of Maine. In April 1969 a giant <br>eighteen-foot-tall figure was seen by many residents on the outskirts of that little town in the Annapolis valley, according to the <i>Evening News</i>. It was allegedly a "tall, very dark form" seen striding about the landscape at a speed of about twenty miles per hour. After the initial witnesses reported the "Phantom," as it became known, local police had to assign two cars to the area to control the bumper-to-bumper traffic.<br>People in Nova Scotia have been seeing all kinds of oddities for years. Giant luminous snakes that appeared suddenly and melted away mysteriously were reported there in 1967.<br>These things are "erratics" and "anomalies." They have been entertaining us for years, and their appearances have spawned all kinds of cults and "crackpot-ologies" ranging from "Angelology" (the study of the frequent appearances of angels) to UFOlogy (the study of flying saucers). Since 1896 a spectacular assortment of weird apparitions have been dropping out of the sky to plague us. A nude giant paid a visit to Michigan in 1897, according to the newspapers of the period, and when a farmer tried to move in for a closer look, the creature lashed out with his giant foot and broke the poor man's ribs.<br>For the past twenty years South America has been infested with beings ranging from eight-foot giants with single eyes in the middle of their foreheads to little man-shaped things only two feet tall. Cyclopean giants have also reportedly been seen in the state of Oregon, and a radio announcer in Minnesota claims he ran into a group of tiny animated tin cans only six inches tall. Other creatures ranging from fifteen to twenty feet in height have scared the daylights out of people in such scattered places as Mexico and Argentina.<br>In West Virginia more than one hundred sober, God-fearing people have seen some sort of tall, gray human-like figure with wings since 1966. It has glowing red eyes and is known locally as "Mothman." A similar creature horrified four teenagers in Kent, England, back in 1963.<br>These are only a few of the examples in our lexicon of monsters and ambling nightmares. There are hundreds more and we will try to give a comprehensive, documented account of each one as we go along. Unfortunately there is very little scientific evidence that any of these things really exist. In many cases unusual footprints were found on the ground afterwards and plaster casts were made of them. In some instances witnesses were clawed or went into a state of shock and required medical attention. Over and over again police officers and sheriffs have thought enough of the witnesses' credibility to organize posses and search parties to scour the area for some trace of these elusive beasts, always without success.<br>You are, of course, familiar with the giant footprints of the celebrated Abominable Snowman (ABSM) of the Himalayas, which have been seen and photographed by numerous mountain-climbing expeditions. But did you know that the same kind of tall, hairy creature has frequently been seen throughout the United States? He--or it--turns up almost annually in such places as California, Michigan, Florida, and New York. Hundreds of people have seen these ABSMs in the past hundred years. All of their descriptions tally. The reliability of most of these people is beyond question.<br>We have personally investigated many of the cases in this book and have talked to the witnesses for hours on end, probing for discrepancies in their stories and trying to uncover emotional or psychological aberrations. It is our studied conclusion that the great majority of these people are telling the truth. Any one of them would make an acceptable and credible witness in a court of law if called upon to testify about a more mundane matter. We are not dealing with wild-eyed crackpots and publicity seekers. These are people very much like yourself and, contrary to the hardboiled cynicism of New York editors, most people are honest and they are particularly truthful when trying to describe an unusual but possibly important event to police officers, newsmen, and scientific investigators.<br>Many of these witnesses will be named in this book. They are real people, they exist, and you can check them out if you wish, although by now most of them are weary of the ridicule and nonsense that usually follows the act of reporting an unusual event.<br>Skeptics who have had no newspaper experience usually try to make an issue out of the reliability of newspaper reports. We grew up in the newspaper business and have been involved in journalism all our life. Newsmen are trained in a hard school and total objectivity becomes a part of their lifestyle. Most newspaper reports are very reliable. We personally have had the opportunity to check out many newspaper clippings by visiting the scene and talking directly to the witnesses. Often we found that the local newspapers had actually protected the witness by playing down or deleting altogether the more incredible aspects of his story. This means that many of the newspaper accounts offer only a superficial description of the event and an in-depth, on-the-spot investigation is necessary to uncover all the details.<br>So we are not going to dwell on the false issues of reliability in this book. Rather, we are going to try to assemble and present the available facts on these bizarre situations. As you go along, you will begin to note that there are striking correlations and similarities in many of these stories, no matter where or when they occurred. The smaller details become the most significant. Identical happenings have been reported in France, Brazil, and Ohio. Yet few, if any, of these stories have been widely circulated beyond the area of origin. If all these people are liars, then we had better launch a psychiatric program to determine how so many far-flung liars are able to come up with the same significant, correlating details in their lies.<br>On the other hand, there exists a large and vocal group of men who <i>are</i> unreliable and often irresponsible. Over the past several years our work has brought us into almost constant contact with this group. They call themselves "scientists" and they usually put a Ph.D. after their names. Science has become a sacred cow in this generation but that term is a misnomer. The gender is wrong. Science, by and large, is a lot of bull.<br>Hardly a month passes that yet another scientist is not caught in the act of faking his statistical material or cheating in his experiments.

"What would happen if we admitted that oppressed groups can themselves be oppressive?" Responding to that challenge are 35 entries, including nine that are new and several that have been updated, ranging from poems and stories to short critiques and a photo-essay. Judith Plaskow refutes recent feminist accusations that the Jews "invented" patriarchy; and Adrienne Rich, daughter of a Jewish father and gentile mother, recalls being assigned the role of Portia in her predominantly gentile school's production of The Merchant of Venice.

For more than fifty years he has regaled us with wonders, enchanted us with memories, and startled us with simple truths, enabling us to view from fresh perspectives the world we inhabit, and see others we never dreamed existed.</p><p>Now the master treats us to another round -- eighteen brand -- new stories and seven previously published but never before collected-proof positive that his magic is as potent as ever. Here is a rich elixir distilled from the pungent fruit of experience and imagination, expertly prepared by a superior mixologist whose hand is sure and whose eyes and ears have long taken in the shouting, weeping, carping, reveling life all around him.</p><p>Sip the sweet innocence of youth, and the wisdom and folly -- of age. Taste the warm mysteries of summer and the bitterness of betrayed loves and abandoned places. This glass overflows with a heady brew that will set your mind spinning and carry you to remarkable locales: a house where time has no boundaries; a movie theater where deconstructed schlock is drunkenly reassembled into art; a faraway planet plagued by an epidemic of sorrow; a wheat field that hides a strangely welcome enemy. The comforts of arguments eternal; the addictive terror of a predawn phone call; the ghosts of dear friends, of errant sons and lost fathers, and of lovers both joyously remembered and never-to-be, are but a few of the ingredients that have gone into Bradbury's savory cocktail. And every satisfying swallow brings new surprises and revelations.</p><p>One More for the Road is superb refreshment served with wit, heart, and flair by the incomparable Bradbury. This one's on Ray.</p><p>Drink up!</p></p><p><p>In a career spanning more than seventy years, Ray Bradbury, who died on June 5, 2011 at the age of 91, inspired generations of readers to dream, think, and create. A prolific author of hundreds of short stories and close to fifty books, as well as numerous poems, essays, operas, plays, teleplays, and screenplays, Bradbury was one of the most celebrated writers of our time. His groundbreaking works include <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, <em>The Martian Chronicles</em>, <em>The Illustrated Man</em>, <em>Dandelion Wine</em>, and <em>Something Wicked This Way Comes</em>. He wrote the screen play for John Huston's classic film adaptation of <em>Moby Dick</em>, and was nominated for an Academy Award. He adapted sixty-five of his stories for television's <em>The Ray Bradbury Theater</em>, and won an Emmy for his teleplay of <em>The Halloween Tree</em>. He was the recipient of the 2000 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, the 2004 National Medal of Arts, and the 2007 Pulitzer Prize Special Citation, among many honors.</p><p>Throughout his life, Bradbury liked to recount the story of meeting a carnival magician, Mr. Electrico, in 1932. At the end of his performance Electrico reached out to the twelve-year-old Bradbury, touched the boy with his sword, and commanded, "Live forever!" Bradbury later said, "I decided that was the greatest idea I had ever heard. I started writing every day. I never stopped."</p>Bradbury's collection of short stories offers a mix of the author's best writing, expertly performed by Campbell Scott. Bradbury's authorial range is on display in this book. The collection alternates between science fiction and literate studies of the human condition, with the requisite twists and turns inherent in all of Bradbury's work. Scott handles the material well, even without significantly altering his voice. Female characters are a bit softer, and older people are scratchier, but Scott keeps us listening. He pauses at just the right time for maximum effect and is at his best when relating conversations. It seems the book's only shortcoming is that it's too short.

In the Swiss Alps, where it is set, a hundred years is just the blink of an eye. We see in her the daughter that every mother dreams of having and every little girl dreams of being. Her presence makes us happy, and so her story has endured. This deluxe Children&#x2019;s Classic edition is produced with high-quality, leatherlike binding with gold stamping, full-color covers, colored endpapers with a book nameplate. Some of the other titles in this series include: Anne of Green Gables, Black Beauty, King Arthur and His Knights, Little Women, and The Secret Garden.</p><p>Johanna Spyri's classic story of a young orphan sent to live with her grumpy grandfather in the Swiss Alps is retold in it's entirety in this beautifully bound hardcover edition. <i>Heidi</i> has charmed and intrigued readers since it's original publication in 1880. Much more than a children's story, the narrative is also a lesson on the precarious nature of freedom, a luxury too often taken for granted. Heidi almost loses her liberty as she is ripped away from the tranquility of the mountains to tend to a sick cousin in the city. Happily, all's well that ends well, and the reader is left with only warm, fuzzy thoughts. Spryi's story will never grow wearisome--and this is a very appealing edition. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i>6 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Flight Patterns</h2><p><b>The <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of the Tradd Street novels<i>&nbsp;</i>tells the story of a woman coming home to the family she left behind&#x2014;and to the woman she always wanted to be....</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Georgia Chambers has spent her life sifting through other people&#x2019;s pasts while trying to forget her own.

Giles straightened, breathing in the heavy scents of lavender and honey, of summer grasses and his own sweat. And something else, too. Something chemical and out of place in his fields of purple and gold. Something that made sense out of the bees lying like carrion for the swarming swallows above.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah! Vous dirais-je, maman,&#x201d; sang his three-year-old daughter with her clear, perfect voice from her perch on an upturned bucket, unaware of the sky or the bees or the tremor of fear that shook the breath from his lungs.</p><p>&#x201c;Colette, calme-toi,&#x201d; he said, putting his finger to his lips.</p><p>The little girl stopped singing and stared up at her father with a question in her dark eyes. He had never asked her to stop before.</p><p>Keeping his finger to his lips, Giles closed his eyes, listening. A low hum escaped from inside the hive, quieter now, a volume dial turned low on a radio. A sign to any beekeeper that something was wrong. The queen had died, perhaps. Or any of the dreaded parasites&#x2014;mites or beetles, even&#x2014;had invaded the hive, taking over an entire population and killing them.</p><p>Or the entire colony had become aware, even before Giles, that the one thing he&#x2019;d hoped and prayed would never happen was now waiting with open arms on his doorstep. And the bees had chosen a sudden death instead of a long, lingering passing.</p><p>He strained to listen, wanting to hear beyond the sound of the bees and the circling birds and his own breathing. There. There it was. The gurgle and thrum of multiple engines. Not cars. Trucks. Large trucks to transport as many people as possible, a slow convoy climbing its way through the small farms and vibrant fields of Provence.</p><p>It was inevitable, he supposed. As soon as the Germans had invaded the free zone in southern France the previous November, there was nobody to protect them. Not even a puppet government. His chest expanded and contracted as a cloud of dust and cut hay churned up by the trucks&#x2019; tires drifted over the winding dirt road in the far distance like poison descending on the valley.</p><p>He thought of the family now huddled in his barn, in the small room he&#x2019;d created beneath the hidden trapdoor covered with bales of hay. A mother and father and three small children, the woman&#x2019;s belly swollen with a fourth. He hadn&#x2019;t even asked their names. These families came and went so frequently that he&#x2019;d stopped asking. It was easier that way, later. When he&#x2019;d learn that some hadn&#x2019;t made it over the mountains to safety it was better that he hadn&#x2019;t known their names.</p><p>Giles cursed under his breath. Three days before, when the cobbler had sent his new assistant, he&#x2019;d known. He&#x2019;d seen the way the young man&#x2019;s eyes had darted about the barn, taking in the tidy table and bench pushed against the wall. The way the cobwebs had been swept out of the corners of the rafters. The neatly stacked tools, carefully placed. All signs of a woman&#x2019;s touch, yet Giles&#x2019;s wife had been dead for three years. Yes, Giles had known even then. And the bees had known, too.</p><p>Half an hour. That&#x2019;s all he had before the trucks reached his farm, saw the brightly painted beehives and the stone house where his family had lived for almost two hundred years in the shadow of the ch�teau. Before they reached the barn and started moving the hay. His nostrils flared as the exhaust fumes overtook the sweet scents of his beloved fields, and he turned abruptly to Colette.</p><p>&#x201c;C&#x2019;est le temps.&#x201d; He picked her up, her warm breath on his neck, and began to run.</p><p>She started to cry before they&#x2019;d even reached the barn, her sobs already hiccups by the time the family had crawled from their hiding place and begun their escape across the lavender fields, their shadows chasing them through the rows of purple.</p><p>In the kitchen at the back of the farmhouse he removed the small leather suitcase that had been Colette&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s, packed the same day he&#x2019;d decided he could no longer be a bystander. Carefully he took the teapot from the hutch, where it had been nestled between its matching cups and plates, the feel of the china fragile beneath his rough hands, as he remembered his dead wife and how she&#x2019;d loved beautiful things, how she&#x2019;d loved to set the table and eat from the delicate plates. The china set had been a wedding gift from the ch�teau to his grandparents, a thank-you for his family&#x2019;s years of service.</p><p>He wrapped it in a small towel and tucked it carefully amid Colette&#x2019;s clothing inside the case, then lifted the little girl into his arms again, pressing his forehead to hers. &#x201c;It will be all right, ma petite ch�rie. Madame Bosco has promised to look after you until I return.&#x201d; He lifted the suitcase and began walking swiftly from the house toward the neighboring farm. The Boscos were a large Italian-French family with seven children of their own and had not asked him why he might need to leave his daughter for an unspecified amount of time. It was better they did not know.</p><p>&#x201c;Non, Papa.&#x201d; Colette&#x2019;s bottom lip quivered, but he dared not slow or look behind him.</p><p>He pressed her blond head against his chest as he walked faster, seeing the lights of the stone farmhouse, white sheets flapping on the clothesline like a warning. The door opened before he reached it. Madame Bosco&#x2019;s large, round form filled the doorway, the light illuminating her. A young girl, dark haired like her mother but slender as a reed, peered out from behind madame.</p><p>&#x201c;Go back inside,&#x201d; the woman said to the girl. &#x201c;Keep your brothers and sisters away from the door.&#x201d; She waited until her daughter had left, the girl stealing a glance over her shoulder only once. Madame Bosco turned back to Giles. &#x201c;It is time?&#x201d; she asked, her voice low.</p><p>Giles nodded, holding Colette even tighter, knowing what a terrible thing he was asking the child to do. And how this very scene must be playing out again and again all over the burning fields of Europe. A chorus of children&#x2019;s cries and parents&#x2019; despair that fell on parched earth and thick air that smelled of burning things. The wailing might be heard, but no one was listening.</p><p>He touched his lips to Colette&#x2019;s sweat-soaked forehead and tearstained cheek, breathing in the scent of her one last time. &#x201c;You are my heart, ma ch�rie,&#x201d; he said, holding her small fist tightly in his own larger one, replaying something they did every night. &#x201c;And only you can set it free.&#x201d; He opened his hand and wiggled his fingers like petals on a sunflower. Even in her misery, the little girl remembered her part and opened her own hand, the small fingers slow and heavy.</p><p>&#x201c;Remember this,&#x201d; Giles whispered in her ear, the folds and curves as delicate as a flower. &#x201c;Remember you are my heart.&#x201d;</p><p>Before he could change his mind, he handed Colette to the welcoming arms of Madame Bosco. There were tears in her eyes as she held the sobbing child. &#x201c;We will keep her safe until you return. We have already instructed the children.&#x201d;</p><p>Giles nodded, remembering her mother, as he stroked Colette&#x2019;s blond curls. He slid a postcard from his pocket and handed it to madame, his thumb obscuring the foreign stamps. The edges were torn and frayed from having been held and read so many times, the image of the beach with impossibly white sand engraved on his memory. &#x201c;If something happens, let my friend know. His name and address are on here. If I can&#x2019;t find you, I will go to him.&#x201d; He paused for a moment. &#x201c;Keep it hidden. It will be safer for you that way. No questions.&#x201d;</p><p>Madame Bosco nodded and he felt the trembling in her hand as she took the postcard. &#x201c;I will pray that I will put this back in your hands along with Colette when this is all over.&#x201d;</p><p>He gave her a solemn stare. &#x201c;I hope God listens to your prayers. He hasn&#x2019;t listened to mine in a very long time.&#x201d; Lifting the suitcase, he set it inside the kitchen door. &#x201c;Be careful with this. I have wrapped something precious inside, something of her home and family. Please keep them both safe.&#x201d;</p><p>One last time Giles pressed his lips against Colette&#x2019;s soft curls. &#x201c;Au revoir, ma ch�rie. I will come back for you; I promise. However long it takes.&#x201d;</p><p>The little girl looked up at him with her mother&#x2019;s eyes, large and dark. She reached for him. &#x201c;Ne va pas, Papa! Don&#x2019;t leave me!&#x201d; She struggled to release herself from the woman&#x2019;s grasp, her legs kicking frantically.</p><p>&#x201c;Be safe,&#x201d; madame said, her own eyes damp. &#x201c;Until we meet again.&#x201d;</p><p>He touched her arm and pressed it, grief like cement filling his throat. With one last glance back, he turned in the opposite direction from his farm and began to run. He heard his daughter sobbing as the sky cast out the light, and imagined he could hear the sound of dead bees hitting the parched earth, lamenting the passing of all that was good.</p><p></p><br><p>Chapter 1</p><p>&#x201c;The bee collects honey from flowers in such a way as to do the least damage or destruction to them, and he leaves them whole, undamaged and fresh, just as he found them.&#x201d;</p><p>St. Francis de Sales</p><p>&#x2014;Ned Bloodworth&#x2019;s Beekeeper&#x2019;s Journal</p><p>Georgia</p><p>April 2015</p><p>New Orleans</p><p>Memories are a thief. They slip up behind you when you least expect it, their cold hands pressed against your face, suffocating. They blow icy-cold air even on the hottest days, and pinch you awake in the middle of the night. My grandfather had once told me that memories were like a faucet you could turn on or off at will, and that after I got to be as old as he was, I&#x2019;d have figured out how it works. Maybe I just wasn&#x2019;t old enough, because my memories always had a way of getting stuck in the on position, flooding my mind with images and snatches of conversations I&#x2019;d rather not relive.</p><p>Perhaps that explained my obsession with old things, with antique clocks, armoires, and shoes. My fascination with ancient books filled with brittle paper, mismatched china pieces, and old-fashioned keys and their corresponding locks. It was as if these relics had been left for me to claim as my own, to make up a past that was devoid of my own memories.</p><p>Old china was my favorite. It allowed me to live vicariously through somebody else&#x2019;s imagined life, to participate in family meals and celebrations, to pretend to be a part of a bride&#x2019;s place-setting selection. Experiences from somebody else&#x2019;s life, but definitely not my own. Despite, or probably because of, my family&#x2019;s well-grounded belief that I was born to founder, I&#x2019;d discovered a vocation I not only loved but was actually good at. I was an expert in most things antique, a sought-after consultant, and proof that it&#x2019;s possible to become someone different from the person you&#x2019;d once been. The person everybody expected you to still be. If only I could have figured out how to turn off the memories, I might have been able to sink comfortably into the new life I&#x2019;d created from old china and discarded furniture.</p><p>I dipped a cotton swab into the cleaning solution and dabbed at the intricate scrollwork of the padlock on my desk. The silver shield-shaped lock with grained bar-and-diamond-embellished trim had been found in a box of old horse tackle in a barn in New Hampshire at an estate sale. Mr. Mandeville, my boss, and owner of the Big Easy Auction Gallery, had grudgingly let me go. I had a good eye and an even better instinct about these things, and after eight years of my working for Mr. Mandeville, he&#x2019;d finally started to agree. I would study the history of a property and its owner when an estate sale was announced so that I could look at pictures of boxes stacked in an old barn or pushed against the walls of a humid attic and know what treasures I&#x2019;d find.</p><p>I wouldn&#x2019;t say that I was particularly happy, or as successful as I&#x2019;d like to be, but there was nobody in my life to ask me whether I was. Nobody to hold up a mirror to make me see whom I had become, or to see the person I&#x2019;d been who had never really believed she could be anything more than ordinary. My mother had once told me that she didn&#x2019;t know that particular sorrow, the sorrow of being ordinary. But I did. And I relished it, if only because it made me not her.</p><p>I opened the large bottom drawer of my desk, listening to the clink and slide of dozens of mismatched keys and padlocks I&#x2019;d collected over the years, my hope of finding a matching key and lock one of the stupid little games I played with myself. I&#x2019;d just grabbed a fistful of keys when I heard the front door of the building open, the bell clanging ominously in the empty space. It was Sunday, the offices and gallery below were closed, and nobody was supposed to be there. Which was precisely why I was there, unconcerned about the vintage jeans with frayed bell-bottoms that sat a little too low on my hips, flip-flops, a 1960s tie-dyed T-shirt, and hair pulled back in a ponytail that made me look about ten years old.</p><p>&#x201c;Georgia?&#x201d; Mr. Mandeville called up the stairs. The gallery was an old cotton warehouse on Tchoupitoulas, and every word bounced and ricocheted off the brick walls and wood floors unencumbered by rugs or wall coverings of any sort.</p><p>I stood to let him know where I was, then froze as I heard another male voice and two sets of footsteps climbing the stairs.</p><p>&#x201c;Georgia?&#x201d; he called again.</p><p>Knowing he&#x2019;d probably seen my car in the small parking lot behind the building, I sat down behind my desk, hoping to at least hide my flip-flops.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in my office,&#x201d; I shouted unnecessarily, their footsteps coming to a stop outside my door. &#x201c;Come in.&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Mandeville opened the door and stepped through, then ushered his companion inside. The tall ceilings and windows dwarfed most people, including my boss, but not the visitor. He was very tall, maybe six feet, four inches, with thick and wavy strawberry-blond hair. As a person who studied objects of beauty for a living, I decided that&#x2019;s what he was and didn&#x2019;t bother to hide my scrutiny.</p><p>He was lean but broad shouldered, the bones in his face strong and well placed, his eyes the color of cobalt Wedgwood Jasperware. As they approached, I stood, forgetting what I must look like, and allowed my gaze to rove over the full length of him like I would a Victorian armoire or Hepplewhite chair. I&#x2019;d started to grin to myself as I realized I must be one of a very small number of women who&#x2019;d compare a handsome man to a piece of furniture.</p><p>He must have caught my grin, because the man stopped about five feet from me, a pensive look on his face. It took me a moment to realize that he was studying me with the same examination I&#x2019;d just given him.</p><p>I sat down quickly, chagrined to know that I wasn&#x2019;t as immune as I believed myself to be.</p><p>Mr. Mandeville frowned slightly at me seated behind my desk. I knew he had issues with my insistence on solitude and working long hours. He was a family man who thrived on noise and bustle and the adoration of his employees and extended family. But he&#x2019;d never had concern over my manners. Until now, apparently.</p><p>&#x201c;Georgia Cha...</p></p><h2>The Complete Book of Sewing New Edition</h2><p>A comprehensive, practical handbook for sewers of all ability levels furnishes step-by-step, easy-to-follow instruction that guide beginners through basic steps and provides the professional skills they require to accomplish a wide variety of sewing tasks, covering a host of sweing techniques; updated tips on equipment, tools, and supplies; an all new fabric gallery, and more.</p><p>Chris Jeffreys leads a team of expert sewing writers and contributors on The Complete Book of Sewing. She taught needlework and embroidery for a number of years; since then Chris has contributed as a writer, consultant and editor to many magazines and books, including Essentials, Sew Stylish, and Successful Sewing.With step-by-step instructions and illustrations of everything from the different types of scissors to the method for facing a waistband, this sewing manual, revised from the 1996 original, offers beginner and intermediate sewers a wealth of information. Hosegood starts with equipment, moves on to working with patterns and covers threads and fabric types; she then moves into actual sewing: handstitching, making pleats, finishing sleeves and applying pockets, among numerous other topics. There aren't any actual patterns, but there are plenty of color drawings and photographs to guide sewers on their own projects. Each section contains brief introductory remarks, definitions (e.g., the difference between a knife pleat and a box pleat) as well as a sidebar of related techniques. For anyone who needs more guidance than a store-bought pattern provides, this should prove a useful resource. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Lyonesse: Madouc</h2><p>Madouc, a vibrant young princess, holds the key to ending the war that ravages the Elder Isles</p><p>Jack Vance is one of the greats of science fiction.

The result is a magnificently-beautiful and thought-provoking collection of fine art, Journeys with the Messiah. These compelling photographs capture 1st Century Jesus intimately interacting with 21st Century Wall Street executives, high rollers, Nazis and people of questionable character. Produced in the ancient Italian city of Matera, this one-of-a-kind photographic journey incites a fresh perspective of Jesus. It is a journey for all people of all faiths. Michael s vision to share these images includes a limited edition fine art collection, an exhibit, the Journeys Book, DVD, posters, interactive web site and more. Journeys&#x2019; Parable book features 33 photographs along with the messages each image depicts as they take you on a personal journey to experience God&#x2019;s grace through Jesus as presented from the unique perspective of the artist. The photographs are bound together in this beautiful 80-page casebound book &#x2013; 8.625&#x201d; x 10&#x201d;.</p><p>After working for a leading clothing company, Michael Belk channeled his experience and fashion knowledge along with his passion for photography into a successful advertising boutique. For more than 30 years, he created images for many of the leading names in fashion. His work appeared in publications that included Vogue, GQ and Vanity Fair. Along the way, Michael began hearing God ask, What are you doing with all that I gave you? Are you using it only for yourself or are you sharing it with others? Eventually the voice grew so loud that he decided to answer the question. Although Journeys with the Messiah began as a project, it soon became Michael&#39;s personal journey, a journey to understand Jesus messages in ways I never imagined. And soon, he suspected that God was sending him on a mission to share his discoveries with everyone. Now, his unique images and their simple, yet powerful and thought-provoking, messages are touching hearts around the world.I cannot recall the last time I was so absolutely inspired as I was when I first saw the incredibly beautiful photography and artistic representations of Jesus created by Michael Belk in Journeys with the Messiah. Michael s images are astounding - capturing the stories and parables of the New Testament in wonderfully creative and imaginative ways. They challenge how people think about Jesus by combining the look and era of a 1st Century Jesus with 21st Century people and elements. They help us see Jesus relevance in our lives today. What a powerful way to communicate the gospel and glorify Him! I often say that our intimacy with God determines the impact of our lives. From these photographs, I can see how profoundly Michael loves the Lord and how he has dedicated his life to Him. I know that God will use Michael s work to draw many people to Jesus and open their eyes to their need for the Savior. We have been blessed as Michael shared these images and his testimony, vision and ministry with our congregation at First Baptist Atlanta and with our In Touch Ministries staff. May God bless him as he continues to serve God through Journeys with the Messiah. --Charles F Stanley</p><h2>Dawn&#39;s Early Light</h2><p>Volume 1 of The Williamsburg Series</p><p><b>Elswyth Thane </b>(1900&#x2013;1984) was the author of over thirty books of fiction and nonfiction.<b>Leila Meacham </b>is the bestselling author of <i>Roses</i>, <i>Tumbleweeds</i>, <i>Somerset</i>, and <i>Titans</i>, among others.<br>&#x201c;A work of extraordinary historical fiction . . . a memorable testament to the price paid for our nation&#x2019;s freedom.&#x201d; &#x2014;Leila Meacham, from her foreword<br></p><h2>The Hedonism Handbook: Mastering The Lost Arts Of Leisure And Pleasure</h2><p>In the age of Oprah, Dr. Phil, and countless other self-help disciplinarians, indulging in any kind of pleasurable pastime is on the brink of extinction. But it&#39;s not too late to revive those lost pleasures that make life worth living. The Hedonism Handbook can help put the three-martini lunch, the baguette with real butter, the deep tan, the unfiltered cigarette, or the simple act of lying in a hammock under the stars back within our grasp. A tongue-in-cheek, satirical guide to the &#34;good&#34; life, The Hedonism Handbook will help us reclaim it all.With his characteristic wit, author Michael Flocker combines humorous reviews of historical excesses, suggestions for everyday indulgences, lists of hedonistic icons with famous quotes and earnest warnings about the perils of structured living. Made up of ten worldly wise chapters arranged to form a journey for the reader-a path from the straight-and-narrow into wide-open fields of frivolity-The Hedonism Handbook will help readers master the lost arts of leisure and pleasure. It provides an entertaining, yet (if you&#39;re not careful), life-changing read.</p><p>The author of the best-selling <i>The Metrosexual Guide to Style</i>, <i>The Hedonism Handbook</i>, and <i>The Fame Game</i>, <b>Michael Flocker</b> lives in New York City.Built around the notion that a new wave of self-help puritanism&#x2014;abetted by the good ol&#x2019; American drive toward success and eternal youth&#x2014;is stifling the nation with "tedious" ideals, Flocker&#x2019;s campy little volume aims to redirect readers toward a more lofty goal: the pursuit of pleasure. Fans of Flocker&#x2019;s previous book, the bestselling Metrosexual Guide to Style, will appreciate his clever lists and section titles: e.g. "Top Ten Reasons Big Rats Abandon the Race" and "Looking Good&#x2014;Buy the Outfit, Screw the Phone Bill." The pages are delightfully laid out, with amusing marginalia and wonderful Victorian-era illustrations, and there are plenty of barbs to keep readers chuckling. For example, writing of May-December relationships, Flocker quips: "The trick, on both sides of the fence, is to feign serious interest." But the book nonetheless feels a bit too weakly espoused. For one, Flocker&#x2019;s ideas and examples appear grasped-at rather than pondered-on. For another, he&#x2019;s constantly hedging his argument, always calling for caution and balance in the indulgences he espouses, as though afraid of a backlash from the very forces that he mocks. Flocker&#x2019;s first book was notable for its dissection of an existing trend; it seems unlikely that his second will spark a new one. That said, this little red book does have its moments of wit, joy and even profundity and, as a novelty gift, it could make a charming nudge to one&#x2019;s partner in crime.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now, with <em>Lost Chords</em>, musician-historian Richard M. Sudhalter challenges this narrow view, with a book that pays definitive tribute to a generation of white jazz players, many unjustly forgotten--while never scanting the role of the great black pioneers.<br> Eagerly awaited by the jazz community, this monumental volume offers an exhaustively documented, vividly narrated history of white jazz contribution in the vital years 1915 to 1945. Beginning in New Orleans, Sudhalter takes the reader on a fascinating multicultural odyssey through the hot jazz gestation centers of Chicago and New York, Indiana and Texas, examining such bands such as the New Orleans Rhythm Kings, the Original Memphis Five, and the Casa Loma Orchestra. Readers will find luminous accounts of many key soloists, including Bix Beiderbecke, Benny Goodman, Jack Teagarden, Red Norvo, Bud Freeman, the Dorsey Brothers, Bunny Berigan, Pee Wee Russell, and Artie Shaw, among others. Sudhalter revives the once-great reputations of these and many other major jazzmen, pleading their cases persuasively and eloquently, without ever descending to polemic. Along the way, he gives due credit to Louis Armstrong, Lester Young, Duke Ellington, Coleman Hawkins, and countless other major black figures.<br> Destined to become a basic reference book on the subject, <em>Lost Chords</em> is a ground-breaking book that should significantly alter perceptions about jazz and its players, reminding readers of this great music's multicultural origins.</p><p><br><strong>Richard M. Sudhalter</strong> is a highly respected musician, one of today's outstanding trumpet players. A noted critic, broadcaster, and historian, he was co author of <em>Bix: Man and Legend</em>, still cited as the definitive Beiderbecke biography. He lives on Long Island's North Fork.<br>In his massive and erudite study, trumpeter and Bix Beiderbecke biographer Sudhalter makes the case that white musicians have been unfairly overlooked in the canonical histories of jazz. Sure to stir up controversy among critics, scholars and fans of "American classical music," Sudhalter's history argues that the rise of multiculturalism, for all its positive effects on society at large, has helped foster a popular misconception of jazz as an art form dominated by African-Americans. While Sudhalter's polemical position provides structure to what otherwise might have become an unwieldy and anecdotal discussion, it creates conceptual difficulties. Sudhalter fails to establish how race worked in early 20th-century America, taking for granted that, like today, Sicilian, Jewish and Irish musicians would have been regarded as "white." However, a number of recent studies have suggested that the full privileges of "whiteness" didn't extend to members of these ethnic groups at the turn of the century. The book?which includes profiles of a number of celebrated European-American jazzmen?Beiderbecke, Bunny Berigan, Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw, to name a few?is at its most intriguing when examining such lesser known figures as the sweetly tragic New Orleans cornetist Emmett Hardy, the multitalented bandleader Adrian Rollins and the irascible braggart Nick LaRocca, leader of the seminal Original Dixieland Jazz Band. Whether or not you buy Sudhalter's basic premise, there's much to be learned from his scholarly, sometimes combative, narrative. Photos not seen by PW. (Jan.) FYI: A two-CD companion album will be released by Challenge Records to coincide with publication. Sudhalter is planning a second volume.<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving in</h2><p>Describes a method of negotiation that isolates problems, focuses on interests, creates new options, and uses objective criteria to help two parties reach an agreement</p><p>We're constantly negotiating in our lives, whether it's convincing the kids to do their homework or settling million-dollar lawsuits.

Instead we glimpse an immensely varied, post-feudal China struggling to modernize in the face of persistently low living standards. One hundred eighty-five candid color photographs show ferryboats and junks; meat shops where slaughtered cats and dogs are sold as food; careworn peasants, student artists, nude bathers, duck farmers; ancestor worshippers, devout Muslims and Tibetan lamaists. Kubota, born in China but launched on his photographic career in the U.S., traveled through the People's Republic from 1979 to 1984. He roamed from northwestern deserts to Manchurian forests, from ice-fishing in subzero temperatures to tribal "water festivals." Yet, somehow, the Chinese people and the country's political climate remain elusive in all of this. November 25<br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.The 185 photographs presented here are chosen from 200,000 that Kobota took in China between 1978 and 1985. He filmed all regions, including tropical Kishuangbanna, Guilin's mountains (from the air), the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, and the snow and smokestacks of northern Manchuria. He generally saw people in group activity, whether at prayer or wrestling or bicycling to work, and he waited for the precise moment to photograph. The results are superb, calling the viewer to pore over the wealth of detail in foreground and background. Captions are essential; unfortunately they are segregated at the end. Even so, this sets a new standard of excellence among photographic books on China. Elizabeth A. Teo, Moraine Valley Community Coll.

Levenda takes readers through the teachings of Madame Blavatsky, Aleister Crowley, the Thule Gesellschaft - the occult secret society that formed the ideological heart of the early Nazi Party - the Order of the Golden Dawn, and the Order of the Eastern Temple and demonstrates how each influenced Nazi ideology. He also details the expedition to Tibet of the Ancestral Heritage Research and Teaching Society, comprised of the same SS officers who would later be involved in grisly medical experiments on concentration camp prisoners. Levenda traces the Nazis' movements as they continued their activities after the war or morphed into neo-Nazi, skinhead, and satanic groups, such as the Christian Identity and White Aryan Resistance movements. Levenda's is not only a "major work of investigative reporting," but also the striking story of the unholy alliance between politics and religion - or politics and occultism - that has dominated events in Europe and the Americas since World War I, with all its implications for continuing racial and religious violence in Europe, Asia, and the Americas.</p></p><p>Peter Levenda is the author of <em>The Secret Temple: Masons, Mysteries and the Founding of America </em>(Continuum, 2009) and <em>Unholy Alliance: A History of Nazi Involvement with the Occult </em>(Continuum, 2002), which has appeared in 6 foreign-language editions."Unholy Alliance is a treasure of scholarly details about the relatively unelucidated chamber of history where the Nazi Party and a number of higher practitioners of the occult came together and flew apart. So it is a book of startling and sinister coincidences, of murder, magic, and mysterious questions there for us to pursue. Needless to say, it&#x2019;s highly readable."&#x2014;Norman Mailer<br><br>"To belittle National Socialism as a criminal conspiracy to dominate the world is more or less the accepted rule. To blame one man for the horrible disasters Germany caused within twelve years...is also common practice. However, there is more to it, and Peter Levenda, in his breathtaking Unholy Alliance: A History of Nazi Involvement with the Occult, has the answers: The Third Reich was deeply rooted in mystical thinking; its philosophical origins go back thousands of years, and millions of people fell under the spell of its occult rites, symbols and teachings....Levenda&#x2019;s book reaches deeply into the human mind, identifying those dark instincts that draw us to evil and which the Nazis so aptly exploited....Some of the voices heard here today echo the voices Hitler and his gang pretended to hear and used for their apocalyptic purposes. Peter Levenda&#x2019;s Unholy Alliance makes that shockingly clear."&#x2014;Hans Janitschek, President, United Nations Society of Writers and Artists<br><br>"With humor, courage, an eye for irony and through humble scholarship, Levenda draws the relationship between Nazis, the Vatican, the CIA, anti-Communist organizations...a whole slough of occult societies and our own local yokels. Beginning like a good exciting spy novel in the clutches of a dangerous Nazi hideaway in Chile called Colonia Dignidad, Levenda...weaves this dangerous locale into his vast documentation and original research from many archives in a sophisticated and thrilling revelation of cults and their victims....Too complicated for Geraldo and too shocking for Oprah and too damaging to large corporate entities like ITT (which financed Allende&#x2019;s overthrow)....I recommend a serious reading of Peter Levenda&#x2019;s Unholy Alliance."&#x2014;Bob Rudner, Chicago Greens/Green Party USA<br><br>"Peter Levenda's Unholy Alliance is at once a terrific read, an underground classic, and a major work of investigative reporting. Shinning a bright light on the darkest corners of 'history's basement,' Levenda traces and explicates the origins of Nazi occultism from the theosophical enlightenment of the early 20th century to its recent resurgence in North and South America. Rich in documentation and insight, Unholy Alliance is a profound and fascinating book in the tradition of Louis Pauwel's and Jacques Bergier's The Morning of the Magicians."&#x2014;Jim Hougan, author of Spooks and Secret Agenda.<br><br>&#x201c;Peter Lavenda offers readers a thorough yet popular history of the occult background and roots of the Nazi movement beginning in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries....readers come away from reading it with the feeling that the connection between Nazism and the occult is very real.... Open-minded readers should find this book to be a fascinating look at an underemphasized but key aspect of the Nazi movement in terms of its foundational causes.&#x201d; &#x2013;Jim Lewis, Journal of Church and State, Vol. 46, Issue #3, Summer 2004</p><h2>After the Abduction (Swanlea Spinsters, Book 3)</h2><p><p>After two London seasons&#x2014;and a score of resoundingly dull society suitors&#x2014;Juliet Laverick finds herself longing for one man: Morgan Pryce, the dashing scoundrel who kidnapped her two years ago.

A machine aficionado and avid photographer, Robison lives with his family in Amherst, Massachusetts.<b>Prologue<br></b><br> There I was, doing seventy--five miles an hour in the left lane on the Massachusetts Turnpike. Suddenly, without any warning, I found myself transported back to a Boston nightclub, circa 1984. It was eight p.m. on April 15, 2008, when everything changed as I switched on my car stereo.<br> I was fifty years old, half deaf from hanging out with rock and roll bands in my youth, and tired from a long day working on cars. On top of that, I&#x2019;d just left Boston&#x2019;s Beth Israel Hospital, where a team of Harvard neuroscientists had run an experiment on me, using high--powered magnetic fields in an attempt to rewire my brain and change my emotional intelligence. I&#x2019;ve always been weak in that area because I have autism. Some autistic people have trouble talking or understanding language. Others&#x2014;like me&#x2014;generally talk fine and listen some of the time, but we often miss the unspoken cues&#x2014;-body language, tone of voice, and subtleties of expression&#x2014;-that make up such a big part of human conversation. I&#x2019;ve always had a hard time with that. Luckily, my social disability is offset somewhat by my technical skills. But many of the gifts that help me make a living and take care of myself today also left me feeling lonely and broken as a kid. Some vestige of that hurt has remained in me, and that was why I had agreed to join the scientists on what several of my friends had called a crazy quest.<br> The idea of fixing myself with a fancy new treatment had sounded great in theory, but from what I had seen so far, it hadn&#x2019;t worked. The scientists had proposed using electromagnets to rearrange connections in my head. It had seemed like science fiction, and maybe that&#x2019;s all it ever would be. As I got into my car that evening after four hours at the hospital, I was more exhausted and annoyed than when I&#x2019;d arrived. But otherwise, as far as I could tell, nothing had changed.<br> The drive to Boston had taken two hours and now I was facing another two hours to get home. <i>What was I doing there?</i> I asked myself. But I knew the answer&#x2014;-I had volunteered for this research study because the scientists had issued a call for autistic adults, and I wanted to &#x201c;make myself better&#x201d; in some ill--defined but powerfully felt way.<br> Those thoughts and a thousand others were all running through my head when I plugged in my iPod and music filled the car. I&#x2019;d done that same thing a thousand times before and heard nothing more than songs on a car stereo. I hadn&#x2019;t <i>seen</i> anything at all&#x2014;-just the road ahead. This time the result was strikingly different. All of a sudden, I wasn&#x2019;t in my car. I wasn&#x2019;t even in my body. All my senses had gone back in time, and I stood backstage listening to the Tavares brothers singing soul music in a dark, smoky club.<br> Years ago I&#x2019;d stood by those stages as the sound engineer, whose job was to make sure the machinery of the show kept running. These days I hung around the stage as a part--time photographer, following performers through my camera lens in the hope of catching that magic moment. This was something totally different. When I&#x2019;d engineered rock and roll shows all I saw or heard were the little cues that told me everything was okay, or not. Now when I work as a photographer I concentrate so deeply on my subjects that I don&#x2019;t even hear the sounds of the show. That night in the car, the recorded music captured me and drew me into a world of a long--ago performance in a way I&#x2019;d never experienced before.<br> The transition was instantaneous. One moment I was navigating traffic in my Range Rover and the next I was watching five singers in a nightclub. Floodlights hung from the ceiling, illuminating the stage, and I stood just outside the lit area. To my left, on the stage, I saw the Tavares brothers in sport coats and bow ties, with a backup band on the side. A flute player stood in the background, whispering his contributions to the melody every few measures. Tavares is known to the world for singing &#x201c;More Than a Woman&#x201d; from the <i>Saturday Night Fever</i> soundtrack, but they had a long history in New England before that and a much larger repertoire of songs. Thirty years earlier I&#x2019;d been a part of that world, working as a sound engineer and special effects designer. Many of the big Boston venues used my sound and lighting equipment, and I&#x2019;d stood beside countless stages and watched more performances than I could remember. Was I reliving one of those now, or was this a figment of my imagination? I could not tell then, and I still don&#x2019;t know today. All I can say is that the experience felt incredibly real. I could almost smell the cigarette smoke on my clothes. And through it all, some separate part of my mind kept driving the car, though I only know that because I didn&#x2019;t crash.<br> Meanwhile, the sound of their voices was so clear that I let my mind run free. The musicians and their gear were right in front of me onstage. Looking into the wings I saw amplifiers and road cases stacked in the darkness. Scanning the club I saw the keyboard player, with his rack of instruments. One of the singers onstage walked toward me, and I heard the swish of the cable as he carried the microphone in his hand.<br> My vision was crystal clear, my head was full of sound, and I felt totally alive. The sterile digitized songs on my iPod had come to life and the feeling was so magnificently overwhelming that I began to cry. Not because I was happy or sad, but because it was all so intense.<br> I turned up the volume and sank deeper into the melody. The brothers kept singing, my car kept driving, and tears ran down my face. I felt the beauty of the sound wash over me, and every note was brilliant, new, and alive. This was similar to the way I heard music thirty years earlier, when I had spent every waking moment listening to performances, watching audio signals on my oscilloscope screen, or visualizing the sounds of instruments in my mind. Back then, &#x201c;listening&#x201d; was such a detailed experience that I&#x2019;d recognize individual instruments and their positions on the stage. I&#x2019;d hear the voices of each background singer, distinct, as he or she stepped up for a chorus. But now the experience was richer and deeper, with an added layer of feeling.<br> Suddenly I had an insight: Perhaps I was hearing music pure, and true, without the distorting lens of autism. Perhaps others heard that emotion all along, and now I could too. Maybe that was why I had cried&#x2014;-because I could <i>feel</i> the music, something that autistic people do not often experience in response to things we see and hear. I&#x2019;d always been able to tell when music was happy or sad, but that night the Tavares brothers&#x2019; music had hit me with a power that was new and unexpected.<br> A few hours earlier, back at the hospital, I had listened to two people shouting in anger as they passed in the hall. <i>He&#x2019;s mad,</i> I said to myself, without a trace of emotion attached to the observation. I was an accurate, logical observer. Now, as I listened to Tavares sing, tears ran down my face as I felt the emotions rise up from the lyrics of &#x201c;She&#x2019;s Gone,&#x201d; &#x201c;Words and Music,&#x201d; and &#x201c;A Penny for Your Thoughts.&#x201d;<br> As many times as I&#x2019;d heard those melodies sung, I&#x2019;d never felt them the way I did now. Earlier that day, I would have understood the logical meaning of the words but nothing more.<br> At that moment, I got it. A song like &#x201c;She&#x2019;s Gone&#x201d; wasn&#x2019;t just words and melody, delivered to the audience with artistic precision. It was an expression of love, written and sung for a real person. I wondered who she was and what had become of her.<br> Later that night I sent a message to the scientist who was heading the effort. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s some powerful mojo you have in there,&#x201d; I told him. And we were just beginning.<br> <b>Switched On</b><br> <b>An Electrifying Proposal</b><br> My adventure had started rather inauspiciously a few months earlier. I was standing by a table covered with cookies, at the entrance to the auditorium at the Elms College library in Chicopee, Massachusetts. The cookies were just standard school cafeteria fare, but someone had to eat them, so there I was.<br> I&#x2019;d been invited to Elms to talk to students, faculty, and anyone else who might wander in on a cold January night. Elms had billed the evening&#x2019;s program as an &#x201c;autism workshop,&#x201d; and I was its ostensible leader. That in itself was an extraordinary thing&#x2014;-me leading a college workshop. Until quite recently, the only workshop I&#x2019;d ever run was the one at Robison Service, where we restored Mercedes, Jaguars, and Land Rovers. I wasn&#x2019;t a college professor&#x2014;-I hadn&#x2019;t even gone to college. I&#x2019;d begun as a self--taught engineer who created sound and light effects for rock and roll shows. Twenty years ago I&#x2019;d left that world behind and started a small business. Now I was a car mechanic with a side interest in freelance photography. However, I&#x2019;d just written a book about living with Asperger&#x2019;s syndrome. (That was what clinicians called the type of autism I&#x2019;d been diagnosed with. Today they call all forms of autism the &#x201c;autism spectrum.&#x201d;) I was already getting invitations to come talk about it in some pretty surprising places.<br> I&#x2019;d grown up knowing I was different but having no idea why. The less obvious forms of autism&#x2014;like Asperger&#x2019;s syndrome&#x2014;were not widely recognized until the 1990s, and I wasn&#x2019;t diagnosed until age forty, in 1997. My discovery of how and why I was different was so empowering and liberating that I felt compelled to share the story with the world. The guys at the car shop thought I was crazy to take time off to write a book, but my brother, Augusten Burroughs, had written his own story, <i>Running with Scissors,</i> a few years before and I&#x2019;d felt sure I could do it. Now my book was a reality, and its publication had connected me to more people than I&#x2019;d ever imagined, all fascinated by autism.<br> First were the adults I&#x2019;d met through my local autism society, a part &nbsp;of the Asperger&#x2019;s Association of New England (now called the Asperger/&nbsp;Autism Network, or AANE). They&#x2019;d been great&#x2014;-a welcoming and supportive community that gathered twice a month to talk about the tribulations of everyday life. I was surprised by the extent to which autism tied us together, different as we seemed as individuals. And wherever I spoke I also met parents, many of whom seemed to take encouragement from the fact that I&#x2019;d matured into an independent and self--supporting adult. Their reaction to my success made me think I&#x2019;d dodged a bullet, living in ignorance of my diagnosis for so long. When I was growing up, I never for a moment doubted that I would be able to make a living. What other choice was there? Starvation? Yet many of the parents I was meeting seemed to doubt that their kids could do much more than get dressed in the morning and play videogames.<br> Their low level of expectation was shocking to me, and I began to wonder if it was an unintended downside to the new diagnostic awareness. Maybe today&#x2019;s autistic kids were like wise and wily pets who had trained their parents to feed them, house them, and provide entertainment and healthcare for a lifetime, all for free. When I offered this insight to a few of the mothers they did not find it amusing or enlightening.<br> I had done some speaking about autism before <i>Look Me in the Eye</i> was published&#x2014;-for schoolkids and even in jails&#x2014;-and I initially thought of the book as an extension of my in--person storytelling. After it was published I expected to reach a wider audience, but I never imagined the sort of response I encountered. I&#x2019;d never gotten so many emails, calls, and messages, all from people with a stake in autism. I&#x2019;d imagined creating a book as a cerebral, literary process, but no one seemed to be interested in the technical or creative aspects of my writing. It was all about autism. Everywhere I went, readers questioned me about the ideas I expressed and the things I believed. One of the first to make contact was Jim Mullen, then the president of Elms College. He&#x2019;d gotten a prepublication copy, read it, and invited me to tour their campus and their new autism program. Jim introduced me to the faculty and asked if I wanted to get involved. They were developing a graduate program in autism therapy, and I was flattered to think that my ideas might make a useful addition to their curriculum. And I imagined it might be fun to surprise the faculty members who brought their Subarus and Volvos to my car complex for service. I&#x2019;d always joked with them, saying, &#x201c;You never know what a car mechanic will do next!&#x201d;<br> That was my answer whenever a client of my car company encountered me moonlighting as a photographer on the edge of a concert stage, up on an acrobat&#x2019;s high wire, or in the circus ring with a lion. With my photographer&#x2019;s vest, ID lanyard, and three big cameras hanging off my shoulders, I sure looked different from the way I appeared in our service department. And being six foot four, I guess I&#x2019;m a hard guy to miss. The funny thing was, I was perfectly in my element among performers and musicians, and they would have thought it just as strange to see me in the shop at Robison Service, surrounded by broken Jaguars and BMWs. Now publishing a book had led me to a new place&#x2014;-one where no one from my past would have expected to find me. The night of the workshop at Elms College, I&#x2019;d had just four months to adapt to my new role as &#x201c;autism expert.&#x201d;<br> Nowhere in my book had I claimed to be knowledgeable about anything but cars, electronics, and my own life. Nonetheless, readers said my lived autism insights made me an expert on that, and I was doing my best to meet their expectations.<br> The only worry that would sometimes creep into my mind was that I wasn&#x2019;t an accredited autism professional. My expertise was limited to my own experience of growing up different. The prospect of giving wrong advice by example worried me a lot, so I resolved to learn as much as I could about autism. I couldn&#x2019;t change the way people saw me, but I could change my foundation of knowledge, and I set out to do that as quickly as possible.<br> I never knew who would be in the audience at my talks. Some of the folks who came to hear me speak were established autism clinicians and therapists. I met teachers, counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists, and physicians. They often expressed fascination with my stories, and I wondered how to interpret that. Did they identify with my experiences? Or were they thinking something like, <i>This lab specimen can talk!</i> There was probably a bit of both.<br> Whenever a professional approached me, I listened very intently because I never knew when I might learn something vital. The problem was distinguishing genuine experts from trolls, opinionated laypeople, and the occasional crank. When Lindsay Oberman walked up to me that night at Elms College, I didn&#x2019;t know who she was or where she fit into the puzzle. She seemed the right age to be attending the school, and that&#x2019;s what I first assumed. She looked like a typical grad student&#x2014;-young, enthusiastic, and conservatively dressed in jeans and a sweater. Some of the people at the Elms event wore fancy jewelry or sported exotic tattoos or piercings, but Lindsay&#x2019;s only adornment was a handbag and a book.<br> Despite the simplicity of her appearance, she managed to stand out. Even now, I can&#x2019;t say what it was about her that made such an impression on me. Maybe someone who reads people better than I do...</p><h2>Golden Boy: The Untold Story of William Holden</h2><p>A portrait of William Holden details the actor&#39;s life, film career, and personal relationships and reveals the darker side behind the golden public image</p><p></p><h2>Merriam-Webster&#39;s Dictionary and Thesaurus</h2><p>Presents sixty thousand dictionary entries and more than thirteen thousand thesaurus entries along with usage examples and word guidance.</p><p><p>For more than 150 years, in print and now online, Merriam-Webster has been America's leading and most-trusted provider of language information.

Boy is quite taken with Arturo's daughter Snow, but it's the daughter she has with Arturo that complicates their quiet lives--Bird's birth reveals that both Arturo and Boy are light-skinned African-Americans passing for white. Harkening back to the great passing narratives, like Charles W. Chesnutt's <em>The Marrow of Tradition</em> and, most notably, <em>Passing</em> by Nella Larsen, <em>Boy, Snow, Bird</em> is about both the exterior and interior complexities of racial identity. The perception of Arturo and Boy's race and social class is threatened by Bird. But it's the psychological conflicts that are the most devastating. Arturo was raised with "the idea that there was no need to ever say, that if you knew who you were then that was enough, that not saying was not the same as lying." Is passing dishonest if it isn't an active decision? <em>Boy, Snow, Bird</em> is a retelling of <em>Snow White</em>, and the wit and lyricism of Helen Oyeyemi's prose shares the qualities of a fable. But this novel isn't content to conclude with an easy moral. In fact, Oyeyemi complicates the themes she establishes. Her writerly charms shouldn't be taken for granted; the beauty of her writing hides something contemplative and vital, waiting to be uncovered by readers. <em>--Kevin Nguyen</em></p>Helen Oyeyemi&nbsp;is the author of five novels, most recently&nbsp;<i>White Is for Witching</i>, which won a 2010 Somerset Maugham Award, <i>Mr. Fox</i>, which won a 2012 Hurston/Wright Legacy Award, and <i>Boy, Snow, Bird</i>.

And no one was permitted to speak of it, or of the time before or of the Above. But it was the Fall that established many things in Hell, not the least of which was the distribution of territory. The future wards of Hell were randomly determined as each Demon Major, on his own sizzling trajectory from the Above, plunged headlong, meteoric, into the unknown wilds of the Inferno. Some impacted far apart, setting up their realms in relative seclusion and safety, while others, less fortunate, found themselves in close proximity, able to see the rising smoke of their neighbor&#x2019;s arrival. These close arrivals began plotting and campaigning as soon as they could gather about them enough minor demons to form a court. The fratricidal wars that erupted lingered for millennia, occasionally flaring up into major conflagrations. These were the volatile times of Settlement and they were never forgotten by the survivors. Many of Lucifer&#x2019;s original Host were lost, but those that remained, the strong and the cunning, established powerful kingdoms that would grow and prosper.&nbsp;<br>When Eligor Fell he found himself upon a smoking plain cratered with the barely moving bodies of a thousand fallen demons. They lay, as he did, stunned, twisted by their furious descents, and glowing from myriad tiny embers. Eligor had been a foot soldier in the celestial Host, attached to the seraph Sargatanas&#x2019; legions, and could remember nothing of his final moments Above. Somehow, as he Fell, he had managed to stay near his general&#x2019;s flaming smoke-plume.<br>Eligor came upon Sargatanas as he stood upon a wind-whipped bluff, unsteady, the steam of his descent wreathing him. Transformed from luminous seraph to Demon Major, he had lost all of his heavenly trappings and none of his dignity. A corona of embers flitted away from his massive head and Eligor saw it form into a great and complicated sigil for the first time. Sargatanas had been one of the fortunate ones, a demon who had Fallen, uncontested, in an infernal region harsh and inhospitable, albeit rich in minerals and perfect for city-building. Glowing milky white upon a flat plain before them, and bending around a tall central mount, oxbowed a slow-flowing river that would be named Acheron. Here, Eligor somehow knew, a great city would rise.<br>They stood silently, watching the shower of fiery contrails, the paths of slower descents as they approached their new, unwelcoming home. Eligor glanced over at his lord. He saw Sargatanas looking up, beyond the contrails and beyond the clouds, and saw him close his burning eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;A great number of demons gathered about Sargatanas as he set about the founding of his city. The earliest, mostly unknown to him, were those who had descended nearby and, after meeting with him, agreed to join his van. Others traveling from afar, more often than not, had known him from before the Fall and wanted to be by his side, perhaps for comfort, in the new world.<br>Eligor&#x2019;s intuition had proven correct; Sargatanas had seen the same potential in the land near where he had Fallen. The boundaries of Sargatanas&#x2019; future city were vast, yet the Demon Major had walked them himself, pointing out to Eligor the specific features of the landscape that had provoked his interest in this particular spot. The great river, especially, had won Sargatanas over. As he and Eligor approached its steep banks, they smelled a distinct saltiness carried upon the thick air.<br>They peered down into the languorously flowing Acheron and both of them could see tiny forms, indistinct and writhing, in the thick water. An unaccountable deep sadness filled them as their lungs filled with the mist-laden air that rose up, and, after a moment, Sargatanas shook his great head and spun away. The gesture surprised Eligor, breaking the odd reverie that had fallen about him.<br>They left the river and ascended the gradual rise to the projected city&#x2019;s periphery where, standing assembled in a seemingly endless line twenty ranks deep, were countless souls. They were a miserable, deformed crowd, crying and trembling, as yet unaware of what was going to befall them. Sargatanas drew himself up, smoothing his robes as he walked toward them, deaf to the echoing pleas that filled the air. Eligor, too, ignored them, grown accustomed, as he was, to the souls&#x2019; ways.<br>They were the first arrivals, souls who had been sent as the vanguard of humanities&#x2019; effluvia, the damned. A steady stream of them had been arriving since shortly after the demons&#x2019; Fall, and while he was repulsed by them and their ways, Eligor found himself fascinated nonetheless.<br>Their appearance was as grotesque as their croaking chorus; they were as varied and individual as the capricious laws of the demons could create. Somewhere in Hell, somewhere Eligor would never visit, a veritable army of lesser demons had their way with the endless flood of souls as they entered the realm. Legless, headless, corkscrewed, folded, torn, and pierced, each soul wore but the thinnest mask of mankind. No two were alike. And pushed, as if into gray clay by a giant&#x2019;s hand, into each soul was a black sphere, heavy and dull. Sargatanas told Eligor that the Demons Major had fashioned these globes, filled with the essence of the souls&#x2019; transgressions, to serve not only as reminders of their punishment but also as a means for the demons&#x2019; control. Beyond that he did not say, but Eligor marveled at the simplicity of it. As he and Sargatanas passed them, Eligor looked into their fog-white eyes and wondered what they knew, whether there was any remnant at all of their previous lives to be found in the gray husks.<br>Sargatanas approached his new Architect General, greeting him warmly. The Demon Major Halphas, thin and flamboyantly spined, was bedecked in layers of clacking, bone-ornamented robes while above his head blazed his new sigil, an elaborate device that now incorporated the sigil of his liege, Sargatanas, as well. Halphas was smiling as his lord approached. Around him were a half-dozen other demons, his assistants, each of whom looked at their lord with anticipatory pleasure.<br>&#x201c;My lord,&#x201d; Halphas said dramatically, his smile revealing through his destroyed cheeks myriad tiny teeth, &#x201c;we await but your command and the walls&#x2019; foundations will be laid.&#x201d;<br>Sargatanas examined the deep trench and took the maps from Halphas, comparing what he could see with the glyph-dense diagrams that appeared on the chart. He nodded and handed them over to Eligor, who studied them briefly.<br>&#x201c;You have done a flawless job, Lord Halphas. It is obvious to me how much effort went into your careful plans. And I checked the city limits; they are just as I laid out without the slightest deviation. Excellent!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Lord, I am pleased,&#x201d; Halphas said modestly in his scratchy voice. &#x201c;The Overseers only await your command.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We cannot begin soon enough,&#x201d; said Sargatanas. He raised his faintly steaming hand and with a small gesture, a flick of his hand, created a simple fiery glyph that immediately fractured and sped off to the many attending demons. They, in their turn, dutifully produced their own glyphs that rose into the sky, and these, flying along the outline of the wall, galvanized the distant demons who began the process of converting souls into bricks. The wailing grew in intensity, but none of the demons paid it any attention. Conscious of their lord&#x2019;s presence, they were too intent upon beginning the job at hand, as the wall&#x2019;s foundation started to take form around them.<br>Eligor watched in amazement; this was the first time he had witnessed any real construction in Hell. The techniques, he knew, were relatively untried. As each glittering glyph touched a selected soul upon its black sphere it would instantly transform from a solid globe into a thick, black liquid that flowed down into the ground. And even as the liquid began to pool, the glyph&#x2019;s true meaning impacted upon the soul, hammering it, compressing it into a brick, wringing out what little blood there might be, and then sending it tumbling into position in the wall. Silencing its cries forever. And upon each brick, stamped in relief into its wrinkled surface, was the sigil of its lord, Sargatanas.<br>Black and oily Scourges, demon-tamed Abyssals that flapped their short wings and cracked their cranium-mounted whips, darted about keeping the quavering souls in line. Eligor loathed the Scourges but had to admit their effectiveness. Pressed closely together, the clay-colored souls reacted to the commencement of construction in various ways. Some collapsed, some knelt sobbing, while others, wide-eyed, looked stunned and seemed unable to move. Most stood and pleaded at the top of their voices while a few desperate individuals attempted to run, though Eligor, who was watching all this intently, could not imagine where they thought they would go. Time and again, he would watch the well-trained Scourges fly away in short pursuits, mindlessly flailing the fleeing souls until they collapsed. Once they were still, the souls were hooked and brought back to the trench&#x2019;s edge. None ever escaped.<br>The Overseers, arms outstretched, repeatedly created their conversion-glyphs with such rapidity that the overall impression of the growing wall was one of a luminous ribbon of twinkling fire, a radiant necklace set upon the dark bosom of Hell.<br>The Overseers were, under Halphas&#x2019; able tutelage, extremely skilled; it took enormous concentration to create, size, and shape the bricks and set them in place quickly, and some of the demons openly competed with their neighbors, racing to complete their sections.<br>The broad trench filled smoothly and efficiently. Huge gaps were left for the seven massive gates that would be built. Halphas&#x2019; calculations were perfection; Sargatanas had said many times that he thought him the best architect in Hell. As a raw material the souls were malleable and&#x2014;best of all&#x2014;plentiful. A hundred souls every foot created the beginnings of a wall twenty feet thick and ten feet high&#x2014;nothing compared to what the finished wall would be, but a start nonetheless.<br>Eventually, as the numbers of standing souls diminished, the wailing tapered off to be replaced by the low moan of the hot winds. Algol was setting; the long day&#x2019;s work was done. More souls would be collected, more wall would be created, and eventually this moment would become nothing but a distant memory for demon and brick alike.<br>When all was done for the day, Sargatanas walked along the fresh foundation for some distance, hands behind his back, inspecting the site. He was smiling broadly. His city would be built, and this ceremony was its harbinger. His elation was unmistakable, and Eligor and the others could not help but be swept up in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligor watched with growing wonder and enthusiasm as Adamantinarx-upon-the-Acheron rose, layer by layer, like a dark, growing crystal from the fleshy ground. As a moon is to a sun, so was Adamantinarx to the cities of Heaven. Under the guiding hand of Sargatanas, the city&#x2019;s planners did their best with the materials at hand to emulate the splendor of the Above. Eligor suspected that those similarities in architecture were born merely out of the desire of the demon planners to live as they had and not meant to be a cynical parody of a lost world. At times, as he walked the growing streets, Eligor felt at ease, even at home. But at other moments, moments when the memories of his former life came to him, the dark evocation made him sad.<br>The great hunts that Sargatanas organized to rid the nearby Wastes of the Abyssal fauna and the Primordial natives would help cheer Eligor at these times. It was impossible for him to not share the wild exhilaration that everyone felt, charging through the chaotic landscape after the fearless wildlife, and he would soon forget his sadness. The indigenous creatures of Hell posed a continuing threat to the construction of Adamantinarx, and it was challenging, even for former angels, to run them down and destroy them.<br>The city grew quickly and was populated just as quickly. There was no shortage of ready inhabitants. Hell, Eligor thought often, would never have a problem filling its cities. Soon not only demon workers but demons of all description as well as gray, twisted souls by the hundreds of thousands strode the broad avenues dwarfed by the enormous buildings; the only requirement to existing within the city&#x2019;s boundaries was fealty to Sargatanas&#x2019; bidding.<br>And when Adamantinarx had grown for ten thousand years, the two demons had found themselves together, surveying the great city from one of its lofty towers. Eligor, in a moment of sincere enthusiasm, had turned to Sargatanas and said, &#x201c;This exile, my lord, has not been nearly as grievous as we had, at first, thought. So much has been achieved!&#x201d;<br>Sargatanas looked at him and said, &#x201c;But Eligor, this is only the beginning of the beginning.&#x201d;<br>Sargatanas&#x2019; voice, all harmonics and rumbles like the woody intake of some giant pipe organ, had sounded sardonic. Eligor had no reply for his lord. They had spent so much time in Hell already. Eligor would always look back at that small conversation as the moment when the enormity of their banishment&#x2014;of their shared eternity&#x2014;crystallized.<br>Perhaps, Eligor had thought during this early period, this is why there is such frenetic building. Like beasts who groom themselves when confronted with the insoluble, the demons, confronted with the eternity of their damnation, built. What else could they do but attempt to make this place their own? If they had to live in this place forever, they would try to tame it first, make it their own. But he knew that Hell could not be brought to heel. It was a living place, a place with its own will.<br>Sargatanas went about his tasks with a preternatural intensity that bordered on the obsessive. He never tired of directing the large and small matters of state. It was, Eligor guessed, his way of not thinking about the reality of their situation. He seemed, too, to be preoccupied with the affairs of his neighboring fiefdoms. The lands of his mentor from before the Fall, Lord Astaroth, bordered his largest ward, and this pleased him. Astaroth was old, genial, perhaps a little inept in his governing, and Sargatanas looked with some dismay at his old teacher&#x2019;s failures. But, in those early days, he posed no threat to Sargatanas or his realm and peace reigned.<br>Adamantinarx was not dissimilar, in its composition, from many of the cities of Hell; its flagstoned streets ran red with the blood of its souls, its soul-bricks sighed and blinked as one passed them, and its countless low buildings groaned and shuddered like any others in any other infernal city. But it was also the least tortured of Hell&#x2019;s cities, and its underlying openness was due solely to Sargatanas&#x2019; will. Just as Hell&#x2019;s capital, Dis, was a horrific reflection of its creator, Beelzebub, Adamantinarx seemed, to its demonic inhabitants, as tolerant as its lord. There was a difference, a nobility, to this demon. Eligor could see it, as could any who entered Sargatanas&#x2019; court. When he laid the foundations, high atop the center mount, for his many-bastioned palace, he consulted not only with Halphas but also with each of his chief underlings. Eligor saw how this openhandedness affected the court, how it served not only to bring together each demon but also to make them loyal to Sargatanas.<br>During one such consultation, high atop...</p><h2>Blindside (FBI Thriller)</h2><p>In the wake of a series of kidnapping attempts, Savich, Sherlock, and FBI agent Miles Kettering--whose six-year-old son was one of the attempted victims--trace leads to a charismatic evangelist team, a situation that is complicated by a woman&#39;s infatuation with Savich. 400,000 first printing.</p><p>Catherine Coulter is the author of the bestselling FBI suspense novels <i>The Cove</i>, <i>The Maze</i>, <i>The Target</i>, <i>The Edge</i>, <i>Riptide</i>, <i>Hemlock Bay</i>, and <i>Eleventh Hour</i>.When 6-year-old Sam Kettering manages to escape after beingkidnapped, FBI Agents Lacey Sherlock and Dillon Savich pursue hiskidnapper, a creepy Southern evangelist who's into sadomasochism.

Dwelling upon de Kooning's use of preparatory sketches and recycled pictorial elements, the author deflates the rhetoric of action painting that has oversimplified the artist's work. Subsequent essays by Elderfield, Mahony, and Jennifer Field offer erudite studies of everything from the WPA works and the "Woman" series to de Kooning's "full arm" "urban landscapes" and the torqued ribbons of his late canvases. This is a catalogue about biography, sources (many of them from pre-modern painting), process, form, and-particularly in the studies of major works by conservationists Jim Coddington and Susan F. Lake-materials...the many reproductions are invaluable, and Delphine Huisinga's meticulous chronologies are a boon to researchers. (S. K. Rich <i>Choice</i>)<br><br>This volume magnifies and clarifies the great exhibition's many facets, honoring the complexity of de Kooning's historical presence and his work's lasting fascination. Short essays examine various aspects of nine distinct phases of his career; to each phase is appended a detailed chronology and an analysis of materials and methods used in a single representative canvas. In his idiosyncratic syntax, de Kooning once described himself as a "slipping glimpser," referring to his preference for the incomplete or provisional information that a dynamic viewpoint affords, and this teeming book aptly provides slipping glimpses of one of the giants of 20th-century painting.

(Peter Schjeldahl <i>The New Yorker</i>)<br><br>The Museum of Modern Art's generous, even prodigal De Kooning retrospective is the most ambitious show New York has seen in a long time - a lavish, knotty and definitive tribute to a tricky and alloyed genius.

(Carolina Miranda <i>WNYC Culture</i>)<br><br>Predictably awe-inspiring... In its scale, cr�me-de-la-cr�me editing and processional sweep, it's MoMA in excelsis, and for many people it will probably represent this institution's history-writing at its best.

By dint of sheer energy and determination, the teenage orphan escaped the poverty of Florida migrant sawmill camps and, forsaking nursing for hairdressing, moved to New York City. She soon acquired a chain of beauty salons and founded a cosmetic company that bore her name. Her career in aviation stemmed from her marriage to tycoon aircraft manufacturer Floyd Odlum, and she subsequently broke more speed, altitude and distance records than any other pilot, male or female, in aviation history. During World War II, Cochran created WASPS, a women's plane-ferrying corps, lobbied for a separate air force and served as a consultant to NASA.

BOMC selection. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Cochran won numerous honors and set more distance, speed, and altitude records than any other woman aviator. She organized the WASP (Women's Airforce Service Pilot) program in World War II and was the first woman to break the sound barrier. She was a phenomenon in flying and was truly a self-made woman. She overcame a childhood of poverty to start her own successful cosmetics company. The book combines autobiography with important biographical information supplied by "other voices." This technique provides insight and a variety of opinions and facts from personal friends. Cochran died in 1980, but her mark on aviation history is well communicated here. Highly recommended.

This anti-aging bias has prevented us from thinking about old age in a way that feels good or that will create a good elderhood. Removing our ageist blinders, Dr. Thomas provides a motivational and visionary blueprint for old age as a healing force in society.</p><p>William H. Thomas, M.D., is a Harvard Medical School graduate, an author, a geriatrician, a consultant for AARP, and a speaker to diverse health care professionals, academics, and other researchers. He is president of two not-for-profit organizations that promote holistic approaches to aging and elder care. Winner of the America&#39;s Award (established by Norman Vincent Peale and sometimes called &#34;The Nobel Prize for Goodness&#34;), the Molly Mettler Award from the Health Promotion Institute, and an award from the Giraffe Project (for sticking his neck out), Bill Thomas most recently has received a three-year fellowship from Ashoka, a global nonprofit organization that searches the world for social entrepreneurs--extraordinary individuals with unprecedented ideas for change in their communities.2005 Award Winner in Trade-book category -- <i>American Medical Writers Association, September 2005</i><br><br>A ground-breaking book that should change forever the way we think about the meaning of aging. -- <i>Harry R.

In<br> 2006, Christianity Today named it one of the 50 most significant Christian books to be published in the last 50 years. This revised and updated edition describes the releasing of God&#x2019;s power through signs and wonders to refresh, renew, heal and equip His people. Drawing from the teaching of the New Testament and with illustrations from his own experience, Vineyard leader John Wimber persuades the reader to &#x201c;yield control of our lives to the Holy Spirit.&#x201d; Though Wimber died in 1997, his teaching continues to spread throughout the Vineyard movement, through the broader renewal movement and to Christians across the globe, even those who do not consider themselves Charismatic. Co-author Kevin Springer&#x2014;also a Vineyard pastor&#x2014;has found that in the years since its first publication, Power Evangelism has only grown, and the results continue to be explosive. This edition includes a chapter-by-chapter study guide and reflects changes Springer and other power evangelism practitioners have made in presentation&#x2014;not in content&#x2014;for readers in the new millennium.<br></p><p>Since its publication in 1986, the message of Power Evangelism has been embraced around the world. Terms such as "power encounter," "divine appointment" and "signs and wonders" are now common among Christians form a variety of different traditions.&nbsp; Countless books and review have been written defending or attacking its concepts, and seminaries have held theological symposiums to debate the pros and cons of power evangelism, which Wimber defined as "a presentation of the gospel that is rational but that also transcends the rational... a spontaneous, Spirit-inspired, empowered presentation of the gospel [that is] preceded and undergirded by demonstrations of God's presence."<br> John Wimber believed that God called rank-and-file believers to a powerful influence on the world, and in this revised and udpated version, he and Kevin Springer describe the releasing of God's power through signs and wonders to refresh, renew, heal and equip His people. Drawing from the teaching of the New Testament, and with illustrations from his own experience, Wimber demonstrates how the incredible power of God can manifest in our world when we submit control of our lives to the Holy Spirit. This new edition also includes chapter-by-chapter study guides for group and individual use and updates on how power evangelism is being used in the Church today.<br><b>JOHN WIMBER</b> (1934 -1997) was a charismatic pastor and one of the founding leaders of the Vineyard Movement.

In recent years a number of Hollywood stars have taken up the macrobiotic diet because of its many benefits, which include higher energy levels, beautiful skin, a tranquil mind, and a greater sense of connection with the universe. In <em>Mayumi's Kitchen</em>, the woman who worked for seven years as Madonna's private macrobiotic chef shares with the world her dazzling recipes. <br> <p></p> Mayumi Nishimura's unique style of cooking is healthful, intuitive, and easy to stick with. She draws her inspiration not only from Japanese food, which she grew up eating, but also from Chinese, French, Italian, and any number of other world cuisines, as well as from macrobiotic traditions. She believes that enjoyment, above all, is the key to sustainable healthy eating, and that means adapting her cooking to cosmopolitan tastes. The reader will thus discover in her book a number of familiar-looking dishes prepared with macrobiotic as well as more conventional ingredients, in both Western and non-Western styles. <br> <p></p> The centerpiece of <em>Mayumi's Kitchen</em> is her ten-day detox diet. Here readers can enjoy a macrobiotic menu that will transform them from the inside out. Following this are meal-planning tips and recipes for more than fifty dishes, including such favorites as Salmon Soup, Avocado Rolls, Vegetable Lasagna, and Seitan Pot Stickers. There is even a party-food section with recipes for spring rolls, tempura, pizza, and more. <br> <p></p> In all, Mayumi introduces more than 130 mouthwatering recipes, all lavishly illustrated with color photographs. Many are explained in terms of their nutritional value or energy quality, and unfamiliar techniques are made clear with step-by-step pictures. For beginners and lifelong macrobiotic practitioners alike, these dishes will wow and delight. <p></p> <strong>From <em>Mayumi&#x2019;s Kitchen</em>: Brownies</strong> <br><br> These brownies proved incredibly popular with Madonna&#x2019;s back-up dancers, whom I sometimes made snacks for while on tour.

In 1982 she moved to the U.S. and began studying macrobiotics under Michio Kushi--the leading authority in the field--at the Kushi Institute. Later she worked at the school as head cooking instructor. In 2001 Mayumi became Madonna's private macrobiotic chef, joining her on her Drowned World Tour. Between 2001 and 2008, she cooked for the superstar full-time. Currently Mayumi travels between Japan, where she writes and lectures on macrobiotics, and the U.S. She has published four books in Japanese. <em>Mayumi's Kitchen</em>, newly written, is her first book in English.<br></p><h2>The Darkest Star (Origin Series, 1)</h2><p><p><i>In the world of the Lux, secrets thrive, lies shatter, and love is undeniable.</i><br><i> </i><br> #1 <i>New York Times</i>, <i>USA Today</i>, and internationally bestselling author Jennifer L.

In July 2005, Robert Macfarlane and Roger Deakin - author of Wildwood - traveled to explore the holloways of South Dorset's sandstone. They found their way into a landscape of shadows, spectres &amp; great strangeness.

Even though it takes less than half an hour to read, the subtle call to revel in the wonder of the natural world lasts much longer."<br> - Ben East, Observer<br><br> "An impressionistic piece of landscape writing, Holloway evokes the sense that time is densely layered in these secret lanes; many people have trodden here, and their ghosts are still apparent in the deep tree-shaded paths."<br> - Carl Wilkinson, Financial Times</p><p>Robert Macfarlane is the author of Mountains of the Mind, The Wild Places and The Old Ways, and was the Chair of judges for the 2013 Man Booker Prize.

We trust them to ensure fair trials, to protect the rights of all litigants, to punish those who do wrong, and to oversee the orderly and efficient flow of justice.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But what happens when a judge bends the law or takes a bribe?&nbsp;It&#x2019;s rare, but it happens.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lacy Stoltz is an investigator for the Florida Board on Judicial Conduct. She is a lawyer, not a cop, and it is her job to respond to complaints dealing with judicial misconduct. After nine years with the Board, she knows that most problems are caused by incompetence, not corruption.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But a corruption case eventually crosses her desk.&nbsp;A previously disbarred lawyer is back in business with a new identity. He now goes by the name Greg Myers, and he claims to know of a Florida judge who has stolen more money than all other crooked judges combined. And not just crooked judges in Florida.&nbsp;All judges, from all states, and throughout U.S. history.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What&#x2019;s the source of the ill-gotten gains? It seems the judge was secretly involved with the construction of a large casino on Native American land.

Lacy, the owner of the Prius and thus the radio, loathed rap almost as much as Hugo, her passenger, loathed contemporary country. They had failed to agree on sports talk, public radio, golden oldies, adult comedy, and the BBC, without getting near bluegrass, CNN, opera, or a hundred other stations. Out of frustration on her part and fatigue on his, they both threw in the towel early and settled on soft jazz. Soft, so Hugo&#x2019;s deep and lengthy nap would not be disturbed. Soft, because Lacy didn&#x2019;t care much for jazz either. It was another give-and-take of sorts, one of many that had sustained their teamwork over the years. He slept and she drove and both were content.</p><p>Before the Great Recession, the Board on Judicial Conduct had access to a small pool of state-owned Hondas, all with four doors and white paint and low mileage. With budget cuts, though, those disappeared. Lacy, Hugo, and countless other public employees in Florida were now expected to use their own vehicles for the state&#x2019;s work, reimbursed at fifty cents a mile. Hugo, with four kids and a hefty mortgage, drove an ancient Bronco that could barely make it to the office, let alone a road trip. And so he slept.</p><p>Lacy enjoyed the quiet. She handled most of her cases alone, as did her colleagues. Deeper cuts had decimated the office, and the BJC was down to its last six investigators. Seven, in a state of twenty million people, with a thousand judges sitting in six hundred courtrooms and processing a half a million cases a year. Lacy was forever grateful that almost all judges were honest, hardworking people committed to justice and equality. Otherwise, she would have left long ago. The small number of bad apples kept her busy fifty hours a week.</p><p>She gently touched the signal switch and slowed on the exit ramp. When the car rolled to a stop, Hugo lurched forward as if wide awake and ready for the day. &#x201c;Where are we?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Almost there. Twenty minutes. Time for you to roll to your right and snore at the window.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry. Was I snoring?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You always snore, at least according to your wife.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, in my defense, I was walking the floor at three this morning with her latest child. I think it&#x2019;s a girl. What&#x2019;s her name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wife or daughter?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ha-ha.&#x201d;</p><p>The lovely and ever-pregnant Verna kept few secrets when it came to her husband. It was her calling to keep his ego in check and it was no small task. In another life, Hugo had been a football star in high school, then the top-rated signee in his class at Florida State, and the first freshman to crack the starting lineup. He&#x2019;d been a tailback, both bruising and dazzling, for three and a half games anyway, until they carried him off on a stretcher with a jammed vertebra in his upper spine. He vowed to make a comeback. His mother said no. He graduated with honors and went to law school. His glory days were fading fast, but he would always carry some of the swagger possessed by all-Americans. He couldn&#x2019;t help it.</p><p>&#x201c;Twenty minutes, huh?&#x201d; he grunted.</p><p>&#x201c;Sure, or not. If you like, I&#x2019;ll just leave you in the car with the motor running and you can sleep all day.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;He rolled to his right, closed his eyes, and said, &#x201c;I want a new partner.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s an idea, but the problem is nobody else will have you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And one with a bigger car.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It gets fifty miles a gallon.&#x201d;</p><p>He grunted again, grew still, then twitched, jerked, mumbled, and sat straight up. He rubbed his eyes and said, &#x201c;What are we listening to?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We had this conversation a long time ago, when we left Tallahassee, just as you were beginning to hibernate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I offered to drive, as I recall.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, with one eye open. It meant so much. How&#x2019;s Pippin?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She cries a lot. Usually, and I say this from vast experience, when a newborn cries it&#x2019;s for a reason. Food, water, diaper, momma--whatever. Not this one. She squawks for the hell of it. You don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re missing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;ll recall, I&#x2019;ve actually walked the floors with Pippin on two occasions.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, and God bless you. Can you come over tonight?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Anytime. She&#x2019;s number four. You guys thought about birth control?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We are beginning to have that conversation. And now that we&#x2019;re on the subject, how&#x2019;s your sex life?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry. My mistake.&#x201d; At thirty-six Lacy was single and attractive, and her sex life was a rich source of whispered curiosity around the office.</p><p>They were going east toward the Atlantic Ocean. St. Augustine was eight miles ahead. Lacy finally turned off the radio when Hugo asked, &#x201c;And you&#x2019;ve been here before?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, a few years back. Then boyfriend and I spent a week on the beach in a friend&#x2019;s condo.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A lot of sex?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Here we go again. Is your mind always in the gutter?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, come to think of it, the answer has to be yes. Plus, you need to understand that Pippin is now a month old, which means that Verna and I have not had normal relations in at least three months. I still maintain, at least to myself, that she cut me off three weeks too early, but it&#x2019;s sort of a moot point. Can&#x2019;t really go back and catch up, you know? So things are fairly ramped up in my corner; not sure she feels the same way. Three rug rats and a newborn do serious damage to that intimacy thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll never know.&#x201d;</p><p>He tried to focus on the highway for a mile or two, then his eyelids grew heavy and he began to nod. She glanced at him and smiled. In her nine years with the Board, she and Hugo had worked a dozen cases together. They made a nice team and trusted each other, and both knew that any bad behavior by him, and there had been none to date, would immediately be reported to Verna. Lacy worked with Hugo, but she gossiped and shopped with Verna.</p><p>St. Augustine was billed as the oldest city in America, the very spot where Ponce de Le�n landed and began exploring. Long on history and heavy on tourism, it was a lovely town with historic buildings and thick Spanish moss dripping from ancient oaks. As they entered its outskirts, the traffic slowed and tour buses stopped. To the right and in the distance, an old cathedral towered above the town. Lacy remembered it all very well. The week with the old boyfriend had been a disaster, but she had fond memories of St. Augustine.</p><p>One of many disasters.</p><p>&#x201c;And who is this mysterious deep throat we are supposed to meet?&#x201d; Hugo asked, rubbing his eyes once again, now determined to stay awake.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know yet, but his code name is Randy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, and please remind me why we are tag teaming a secret meeting with a man using an alias who has yet to file a formal complaint against one of our esteemed judges.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t explain. But I&#x2019;ve talked to him three times on the phone and he sounds, uh, rather earnest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Great. When was the last time you talked to a complaining party who didn&#x2019;t sound, uh, rather earnest?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stick with me, okay? Michael said go, and we&#x2019;re here.&#x201d; Michael was the director, their boss.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course. No clue as to the alleged unethical conduct?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yes. Randy said it was big.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gee, never heard that before.&#x201d;</p><p>They turned onto King Street and poked along with the downtown traffic. It was mid-July, still the high season in north Florida, and tourists in shorts and sandals drifted along the sidewalks, apparently going nowhere. Lacy parked on a side street and they joined the tourists. They found a coffee shop and killed half an hour flipping through glossy real estate brochures. At noon, as instructed, they walked into Luca&#x2019;s Grill and got a table for three. They ordered iced tea and waited. Thirty minutes passed with no sign of Randy, so they ordered sandwiches. Fries on the side for Hugo, fruit for Lacy. Eating as slowly as possible, they kept an eye on the door and waited.</p><p>As lawyers, they valued their time. As investigators, they had learned patience. The two roles were often in conflict.</p><p>At 2:00 p.m., they gave up and returned to the car, as smothering as a sauna. As Lacy turned the key, her cell phone rattled. Caller unknown. She grabbed it and said, &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>A male voice said, &#x201c;I asked you to come alone.&#x201d; It was Randy.</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose you have the right to ask. We were supposed to meet at noon, for lunch.&#x201d;</p><p>A pause, then, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m at the Municipal Marina, at the end of King Street, three blocks away. Tell your buddy to get lost and we&#x2019;ll talk.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Look, Randy, I&#x2019;m not a cop and I don&#x2019;t do cloak-and-dagger very well. I&#x2019;ll meet you, say hello and all that, but if I don&#x2019;t have your real name within sixty seconds then I&#x2019;m leaving.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fair enough.&#x201d;</p><p>She canceled the call and mumbled, &#x201c;Fair enough.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The marina was busy with pleasure craft and a few fishing boats coming and going. A long pontoon was unloading a gaggle of noisy tourists. A restaurant with a patio at the water&#x2019;s edge was still doing a brisk business. Crews on charter boats were spraying decks and sprucing things up for tomorrow&#x2019;s charters.</p><p>Lacy walked along the central pier, looking for the face of a man she&#x2019;d never met. Ahead, standing next to a fuel pump, an aging beach bum gave a slight, awkward wave and nodded. She returned the nod and kept walking. He was about sixty, with too much gray hair flowing from under a Panama hat. Shorts, sandals, a gaudy floral-print shirt, the typical bronze, leathery skin of someone who spent far too much time in the sun. His eyes were covered by aviator shades. With a smile he stepped forward and said, &#x201c;You must be Lacy Stoltz.&#x201d;</p><p>She took his hand and said, &#x201c;Yes, and you are?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Name&#x2019;s Ramsey Mix. A pleasure to meet you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A pleasure. We were supposed to meet at noon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My apologies. Had a bit of boat trouble.&#x201d; He nodded down the pier to a large powerboat moored at the end of the dock. It wasn&#x2019;t the longest boat in the harbor at that moment, but it was close. &#x201c;Can we talk there?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;On the boat?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure. It&#x2019;s much more private.&#x201d;</p><p>Crawling onto a boat with a complete stranger struck her as a bad idea and she hesitated. Before she could answer, Mix asked, &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s the black guy?&#x201d; He was looking in the direction of King Street. Lacy turned and saw Hugo casually following a pack of tourists nearing the marina.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s my colleague,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Sort of a bodyguard?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need a bodyguard, Mr. Mix. We&#x2019;re not armed, but my friend there could pitch you into the water in about two seconds.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hope that won&#x2019;t be necessary. I come in peace.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good to hear. I&#x2019;ll get on the boat only if it stays where it is. If the engines start, then our meeting is over.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fair enough.&#x201d;</p><p>She followed him along the pier, past a row of sailboats that looked as though they had not seen the open sea in months, and to his boat, cleverly named Conspirator. He stepped on board and offered a hand to help her. On the deck, under a canvas awning, there was a small wooden table with four folding chairs. He waved at it and said, &#x201c;Welcome aboard. Have a seat.&#x201d;</p><p>Lacy took quick stock of her surroundings. Without sitting, she said, &#x201c;Are we alone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, not entirely. I have a friend who enjoys boating with me. Name is Carlita. Would you like to meet her?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Only if she&#x2019;s important to your story.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She is not.&#x201d; Mix was looking at the marina, where Hugo was leaning on a rail. Hugo waved, as if to say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m watching everything.&#x201d; Mix waved back and said, &#x201c;Can I ask you something?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Lacy said.</p><p>&#x201c;Is it safe to assume that whatever I&#x2019;m about to tell you will be rehashed with Mr. Hatch in short order?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s my colleague. We work together on some cases, maybe this one. How do you know his name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I happen to own a computer. Checked out the website. BJC really should update it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know. Budget cuts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;His name vaguely rings a bell.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He had a brief career as a football player at Florida State.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe that&#x2019;s it. I&#x2019;m a Gator fan myself.&#x201d;</p><p>Lacy refused to respond to this. It was so typical of the South, where folks attached themselves to college football teams with a fanaticism she&#x2019;d always found irksome.</p><p>Mix said, &#x201c;So he&#x2019;ll know everything?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Call him over. I&#x2019;ll get us something to drink.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>Carlita served drinks from a wooden tray--diet sodas for Lacy and Hugo, a bottle of beer for Mix. She was a pretty Hispanic lady, at least twenty years his junior, and she seemed pleased to have guests, especially another woman.</p><p>Lacy made a note on her legal pad and said, &#x201c;A quick question. The phone you used fifteen minutes ago had a different number than the phone you used last week.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that a question?&#x201d; Mix replied.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s close enough.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. I use a lot of prepaid phones. And I move around all the time. I&#x2019;m assuming the number I have for you is a cell phone issued by your employer, correct?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. We don&#x2019;t use personal phones for state business, so my number is not likely to change.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;ll make it simpler, I guess. My phones change by the month, sometimes by the week.&#x201d;</p><p>So far, in their first five minutes together, everything Mix said had only opened the door for more questions. Lacy was still miffed at being stood up for lunch, and she didn&#x2019;t like the first impression he made. She said, &#x201c;Okay, Mr. Mix, at this point Hugo and I go silent. You start talking. Tell us your story, and if it has huge gaps that require us to fish around and stumble in the dark, then we&#x2019;ll get bored and go home. You were coy enough on the phone to lure me here. Start talking.&#x201d;</p><p>Mix looked at Hugo with a smile and asked, &#x201c;She always this blunt?&#x201d;</p><p>Hugo, unsmiling, nodded yes. He folded his hands on the table and waited. Lacy put down her pen.</p><p>Mix swallowed a mouthful of beer and began: &#x201c;I practiced law for thirty years in Pensacola. Small firm--we usually had five or six lawyers. Back in the day we did well and life was good. One of my early clients was a developer, a real high roller who built condos, subdivisions, hotels, strip malls, the typical Florida stuff that goes up overnight. I never trusted the guy but he was making so much money I finally took the bait. He got me in some deals, small slices here and there, and for a while it all worked. I started dreaming of getting rich, which, in Florida anyway, can lead to serious trouble. My friend was cooking the books and taking on way too much debt, stuff I didn&#x2019;t know about. Turns out there were some bogus loans, bogus everything, really, and the FBI came in with one of its patented RICO cluster bombs and indicted half of Pensacola, me included. A lot of folks got burned--developers, bankers, realtors, lawyers, and other shysters. You probably didn&#x2019;t hear about it because you investigate judges, not lawyers. Anyway, I flipped, sang like a choirboy, got a deal, pled to one count of mail fraud, and spent sixteen months in a federal camp. Lost my license and made a lot of enemies. Now I lie low. I applied for reinstatement and got my license back. I have one client these days, and he&#x2019;s the guy we&#x2019;ll talk about from now on. Questions?&#x201d; From the empty chair, he retrieved an unmarked file and handed it to Lacy. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the scoop on me. Newspaper articles, my plea agreement, all the stuff you might need. I&#x2019;m legit, or as legit an any ex-con can be, and every word I&#x2019;m saying is true.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Clip-Clop</h2><p><p><b></b></p><p>Every child adores getting twirled and tossed by Mommy and Daddy. <i>Again!

Her warm and witty drawings have been enjoyed by children around the world, and many of her books have been shortlisted for major awards. Nicola enjoys the company of her artistic family. Her husband is an award-winning water-colourist, two of her sons are musicians, and the third is a creative director. Nicola lives in Essex, England.In this familiar tale, what Mr. Horse deems near disaster is just what his riders always wanted. When he asks, "Who wants a ride?" Mr. Horse has many takers among the barnyard's denizens&#x2014;Cat, Dog, Pig and Duck; "<i>clip-clop, clippity-clop</i>" acts as the tale's refrain. Much like a parent eager to satisfy his children's wishes, Mr. Horse agrees to their requests with some safety tips. "Up you get," he repeatedly responds, then "hold on <i>tight</i>!" when the child-like passengers beg him to go faster. Smee's bold black outline and watercolor wash portray the friendly characters against a vast white space, with Dog's wagging tail and the hero's hooves suggesting movement. But once Mr. Horse quickens his pace, the spreads mirror the intensity; the typeface increases in size, as does the image of the steed (with animals atop his back) galloping across the pages. When the four begin to lose their grip, Mr. Horse "skids to a <i>halt</i>!" and the riders tumble safely into a haystack. Though the horse's urgent cries of "Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dearie me!" echo those of a concerned caregiver, even youngest readers will appreciate the animals' exuberant chorus of "Again!" as they climb up for another ride.

Perry&#x2019;s thrilling Christmas novels, recent additions to her unique repertoire, are set in the most joyous season of the year. <br><br>In A Christmas Guest, Mariah Ellison, better known as the vinegar-tongued Grandmama from the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series, makes a stunning appearance in a bracing story full of devious delight . . . and certain death.<br>For Grandmama Ellison, Christmas is no reason to celebrate. And when her daughter and son-in-law plan a Christmas vacation to Paris sans hers truly, the cantankerous Grandmama is forced to stay elsewhere&#x2013;and travels to the chilly, windswept Romney Marshes to spend the holiday with Charlotte Pitt&#x2019;s parents, Caroline and Joshua Fielding. <br><br>Grandmama is immediately miserable. For starters, Christmas with the Fieldings is nothing like the cultured life to which she&#x2019;s accustomed, and the Romney Marshes are unbearably provincial. When Joshua&#x2019;s cousin Maude Barrington arrives, Grandmama is at her wit&#x2019;s end. Although Maude is well traveled and friendly, Grandmama thinks she&#x2019;s improper and strange. But when Maude is found lifeless in bed, Grandmama senses foul play and takes it upon herself to assume the role of amateur detective&#x2013;uncovering not only the truth about Maude Barrington but some startling truths about herself as well. <br><br>Enlivened with bold characters and vivid, witty writing, A Christmas Guest is yet another holiday novella with the perfect combination of mystery and murder mixed with a generous helping of yuletide cheer.</p><p>Anne Perry is the bestselling author of No Graves As Yet, Shoulder the Sky, and Angels in the Gloom; two earlier holiday novels: A Christmas Journey and A Christmas Visitor; and two acclaimed series set in Victorian England.

It was intolerable.<br><br> &#x201c;I am afraid there is no alternative,&#x201d; Emily replied. She was wearing a beautiful morning dress of pale water green with fashionably large sleeves and a sweeping skirt. With her fair coloring, it made her look prettier than she was, and having married money she had airs above her station.<br><br> &#x201c;Of course there is an alternative!&#x201d; Grandmama snapped, staring up at her from her chair in the withdrawing room. &#x201c;There is always an alternative. Why in heaven&#x2019;s name should you wish to go to France? It is only a week and a half until Christmas!&#x201d;<br><br> Emily sighed deeply. &#x201c;We have been invited to spend Christmas in the Loire valley.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Where in France is immaterial. It is still not England. We shall have to cross the Channel. It will be rough and we shall all be ill.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I know it would be unpleasant for you,&#x201d; Emily conceded. &#x201c;And the train journey from Paris might be tedious, and perhaps cold at this time of year . . .&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What do you mean perhaps?&#x201d; Grandmama snapped. &#x201c;There is no possible doubt.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;So perhaps it is as well that you were not invited.&#x201d; Emily gave a very slight smile. &#x201c;Now you will not have to worry how to decline with grace.&#x201d;<br><br> Grandmama had a sharp suspicion that Emily was being sarcastic. She also had an unpleasant and surprisingly painful realization. &#x201c;Do I take it that you are going to leave me alone in this house for Christmas while you go visiting wherever you said it was, in France?&#x201d; She tried to keep her voice angry rather than betraying her sudden sense of being abandoned.<br><br> &#x201c;Of course not, Grandmama,&#x201d; Emily said cheerfully. &#x201c;It would be quite miserable for you. But apart from that, you can&#x2019;t stay here because there will be nobody to care for you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be absurd!&#x201d; Grandmama regained her temper with asperity. &#x201c;There is a houseful of servants.&#x201d; Emily&#x2019;s Christmas parties were among the few things Grandmama had been looking forward to, although she would have choked rather than admit it. She would have attended as though it were a duty required of her, and then loved every moment. &#x201c;You have sufficient housemaids for a duchess! I have never seen so many girls with mops and dusters in my life!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The servants are coming with us and you cannot stay here alone at Christmas. It would be wretched. I have made arrangements for you to go and stay with Mama and Joshua.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I have no desire to stay with your mother and Joshua,&#x201d; Grandmama said instantly.<br><br> Caroline had been her daughter-in-law, until Edward&#x2019;s death a few years ago had left her a widow of what Grandmama referred to as &#x201c;an unfortunate age.&#x201d; Instead of settling into a decent retirement from society, as the dear Queen had done, and as everyone had expected of her, Caroline had married again. That in itself was indiscreet enough, but instead of a widower with means and position, which might have had considerable advantages and been looked upon with approval, she had married a man nearly two decades younger than herself. But worse than that, if anything could be, he was on the boards&#x2014;an actor! A grown man who dressed up and strutted around on the stage, pretending to be someone else. And he was Jewish, for heaven&#x2019;s sake!<br><br> Caroline had lost what wits she had ever had, and poor Edward would be turning in his grave, if he knew. It was one of the many burdens of Grandmama&#x2019;s life that she had lived long enough to see it. &#x201c;No desire at all,&#x201d; she repeated.<br><br> Emily stood quite still in the middle of the withdrawing room, the firelight casting a warm glow on her skin and the extravagant coils of her hair. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Grandmama, but as I said, there really is no choice,&#x201d; she repeated. &#x201c;Jack and I are leaving tomorrow, and there is a great deal of packing to do, as we shall be gone for at least three weeks. You had best take a good supply of warmer gowns, and boots, and you may borrow my black shawl if you would care to?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Good gracious! Can they not afford a fire?&#x201d; Grandmama said furiously. &#x201c;Perhaps Joshua should consider a more respectable form of employment? If there is anything else on earth he is fitted for?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It has nothing to do with money,&#x201d; Emily retorted. &#x201c;They are spending Christmas in a house on the south coast of Kent. The Romney Marshes, to be exact. I daresay the wind will be chill, and one often feels the cold more when away from home.&#x201d;<br><br> Grandmama was appalled! In fact she was so appalled it was several seconds before she could find any words at all to express her horror. &#x201c;I think I misheard you,&#x201d; she said icily at last. &#x201c;You mumble these days. Your diction used to be excellent, but since your marriage to Jack Radley you have allowed your standards to slip . . . in several areas. I thought you said that your mother is going to spend Christmas in some bog by the sea. As that is obviously complete nonsense, you had better repeat yourself, and speak properly.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;They have taken a house in Romney Marsh,&#x201d; Emily said with deliberate clarity. &#x201c;It is near the sea, and I believe the views will be very fine, if there is no fog, of course.&#x201d;<br><br> Grandmama looked for impertinence in Emily&#x2019;s face, and saw an innocence so wide-eyed as to be highly suspicious.<br><br> &#x201c;It is unacceptable,&#x201d; she said in a tone that would have frozen water in a glass.<br><br> Emily stared at her for a moment, regathering her thoughts. &#x201c;There is too much wind at this time of the year for there to be much fog,&#x201d; she said at last. &#x201c;Perhaps you can watch the waves?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;In a marsh?&#x201d; Grandmama asked sarcastically.<br><br> &#x201c;The house is actually in St. Mary in the Marsh,&#x201d; Emily replied. &#x201c;It is very close to the sea. It will be pleasant. You don&#x2019;t have to go outside if it is cold and you don&#x2019;t wish to.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Of course it will be cold! It is on the English Channel, in the middle of winter. I shall probably catch my death.&#x201d;<br><br> To give her credit, Emily did look a little uncomfortable. &#x201c;No you won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she said with forced cheer. &#x201c;Mama and Joshua will look after you very well. You might even meet some interesting people.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Stuff and nonsense!&#x201d; Grandmama said furiously. <br><br> Nevertheless the old lady had no choice, and the next day she found herself sitting with her maid, Tilly, in Emily&#x2019;s carriage. It made slow progress out of the city traffic, then sped up as it reached the open road south of the river and proceeded toward Dover, roughly a hundred and forty-five miles southeast of London.<br><br> Of course she had known the journey would be dreadful. To make it in one day she had set out before dawn, and it would be late before they reached whatever godforsaken spot in which Caroline had chosen to spend Christmas. Heaven alone knew what it would be like! If they were in try- ing circumstances it might be no more than a cottage without civilized facilities, and so cramped she would spend the entire time forced into their company. It was going to be the worst Christmas of her life!<br><br> Emily&#x2019;s thoughtlessness in gallivanting off to France, of all places, at this time of year, was beyond belief! It was an outrage against all family loyalty and duty.<br><br> The day was gray and still, and mercifully the rain was no more than a spattering now and then. They stopped for luncheon, and to change the horses, and again a little after four o&#x2019;clock for afternoon tea. By that time, naturally, it was dark and she had not the faintest idea where she was. She was tired, her legs were cramped from the long sitting, and unavoidably she was rattled and jolted around with the constant movement. And of course it was cold&#x2014;perishingly so.<br><br> They stopped again to inquire the way as lanes grew narrower and even more rutted and overhung. When at last they arrived at their destination she was in a temper fit to have lit a fire with the sheer heat of her words. She climbed out with the coachman&#x2019;s assistance, and stood on the gravel drive of what was obviously a fairly large house. All the lights seemed to be blazing and the front door was decorated with a magnificent wreath of holly.<br><br> Immediately she was aware of the smells of smoke and salt, and a sharp wind with an edge to it like a slap in the face. It was damp, so no doubt it was straight off the sea. Caroline had obviously lost not only her money but the last vestige of her senses as well.<br><br> The door opened and Caroline came down the steps now, smiling. She was still a remarkably handsome woman in her fifties, her dark mahogany hair only lightly sprinkled with the odd silver at the temples, which had a softening effect. She was dressed in deep, warm red and it gave a glow to her skin.<br><br> &#x201c;Welcome to St. Mary, Mama-in-law,&#x201d; she said a trifle guardedly.<br><br> The old lady could think of nothing whatever that met the situation, or her feelings. She was tired, confused, and utterly miserable in a strange place where she knew perfectly well she was unwanted.<br><br> It was several months since she had seen her erstwhile daughter-in-law. They had never been genuinely friends, although they had lived in the same house for over twenty years. During her son Edward&#x2019;s lifetime there had been a truce. After- ward Caroline had behaved disgracefully and would listen to no advice at all. It became necessary for Grandmama to find other accommodations because Caroline and Joshua moved around so much, as his ridiculous profession dictated. There was never a question of Grandmama living with Charlotte, the elder granddaughter. She had scandalized everyone by marrying a policeman, a man of no breeding, no money, and an occupation that defied polite description. Heaven only knew how they survived!<br><br> So she had had no choice but to live with Emily, who at least had inherited very considerable means from her first husband.<br><br> &#x201c;Come in and warm yourself.&#x201d; Caroline offered her arm. Grandmama briskly declined it, leaning heavily on her stick instead. &#x201c;Would you like a cup of tea, or hot cocoa?&#x201d; Caroline continued.<br><br> Grandmama would, and said so, stepping inside to a spacious and well-lit hall. It was a trifle low-ceilinged perhaps, but floored with excellent parquet. The stairs swept up to a landing above and presumably several bedrooms. If the fires were kept stoked and the cook were any good, it might be endurable after all.<br><br> The footman carried her cases in and Tilly followed behind him. Joshua came forward and welcomed her, taking her cape himself. She was escorted into the withdrawing room where there was a blazing fire in a hearth large enough to have accommodated half a tree.<br><br> &#x201c;Perhaps you would enjoy a glass of sherry after such a long journey?&#x201d; Joshua offered. He was a slender man of little above average height, but possessed of extraordinary grace, and the suppleness and beauty of an actor&#x2019;s voice. He was not handsome in a traditional sense&#x2014;his nose was rather too prominent, his features too mobile&#x2014;but he had a presence one could not ignore. Every prejudice in her dictated that she dislike him, yet he had sensed her feelings far more accurately than Caroline had.<br><br> &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she accepted. &#x201c;I would.&#x201d;<br><br> He poured a full glass from the crystal decanter and brought it to her. They sat and made conversation about the area, its features, and a little of its history. After half an hour she retired to bed, surprised to find it was still only quarter past ten, a perfectly reasonable hour. She had imagined it to be the middle of the night. It felt like it, and it was irritating to be wrong.</p><h2>Henri Nouwen (Modern Spiritual Masters): Writings Selected With an Introduction by Robert A.

The close-knit group can hardly believe that their own Sylvia Compson planned her holiday wedding to sweetheart Andrew in complete secrecy, without the help of even one of her friends. Eager to honor the newlyweds, the Elm Creek Quilters hasten to stitch a bridal quilt for their favorite Master Quilter. Until the time comes to unveil the surprise gift, they reason, Sylvia will be the one in the dark. <br> Such little white lies seem harmless enough, especially in the service of future happiness. Yet Elm Creek Manor, and the quilting retreat established there by the Elm Creek Quilters, thrives on the strength of women sharing their creativity, their challenges, and their dreams. Somehow, in the race to commemorate in Sylvia's bridal quilt all that they hold dear about her wisdom, skill, and devotion, they forget to give honesty its pride of place. <br> As the quilt blocks accumulate, the Elm Creek Quilters celebrate the joy of new beginnings and the ongoing success of their business -- until forces conspire to threaten their happiness and prosperity. Two among them falter in their personal relationships, yet they are too proud to share their pain. The financial problems of another leave the quilt project vulnerable to a malicious act that may prevent its completion. And as two others weigh the comfort of the present against dreams of a future far from Elm Creek Manor, closely guarded secrets strain the bonds of friendship with those who may be left behind. <br> The <i>Dallas Morning News</i> has praised the Elm Creek Quilts series as "classics of their kind," and <i>The Master Quilter</i> is Chiaverini's latest gift to readers.</p><p>Jennifer Chiaverini is the author of the<i> New York Times </i>bestselling Elm Creek Quilts series, five collections of quilt projects, and several historical fiction novels.

While Sylvia Compson's friends were helpfully -- we thought -- planning her wedding to Andrew Cooper, Sylvia and Andrew made plans of their own. Friends and family gathered at Elm Creek Manor to celebrate Christmas Eve and found ourselves unsuspecting guests at the union of two very dear friends.<br><br>The bride was beautiful, the groom charming, the ceremony moving, and the celebration joyful (although admittedly a few of us spent most of the reception recovering from shock). It was a perfect wedding save one glaring omission: Sylvia's bridal quilt. We had not yet sewed a single stitch!<br><br>Diane says Sylvia deserves to go without, but the rest of us know that that would be a cruel punishment for someone who has brought quilting into the lives of thousands of aspiring quilters. That's why we're asking all of Sylvia's friends, family, former students, and admirers to help us create a bridal quilt worthy of everyone's favorite Master Quilter.<br><br>If you would like to participate in this very special project, please make a 6-inch pieced or appliqu�d quilt block using green, rose, blue, gold, and/or cream 100% cotton fabrics. Choose any pattern that represents how Sylvia has influenced you as an artist, teacher, or friend.<br><br>Please mail your blocks so they arrive at Elm Creek Manor no later than April 1. If you have any questions, contact Sarah McClure or Summer Sullivan at Elm Creek Manor. Thanks so much for your help, and remember, this is a surprise! Let's show Sylvia we can keep a secret as well as she can.<br><br>Yours in Quarter-Inch Seams,<br><br>The Elm Creek Quilters<br><br>"Did Diane really say that?" asked Summer as she read over the draft.<br><br>"No," admitted Sarah, "but it sounds like something she would say, and I thought it was good for a laugh. Should I delete it?"<br><br>"No, leave it in. Just don't send her a copy."<br><br>Sarah and Summer exchanged a grin, imagining Diane's reaction. Diane had been the last of the Elm Creek Quilters to admit that the Christmas Eve surprise wedding had been truly wonderful -- and that was not until a week later, and only grudgingly. For all they knew, maybe Diane had indeed declared that Sylvia deserved to go without a bridal quilt for not sharing her secret with her closest friends.<br><br>"Don't you think Sylvia will get suspicious when dozens of blocks start piling up in the mailbox?" asked Summer.<br><br>"I'll ask Bonnie if we can have the blocks sent to Grandma's Attic," said Sarah. Bonnie would probably be able to find room in her quilt shop to store the blocks, too, rather than leave them lying about Elm Creek Manor where Sylvia might discover them.<br><br>A phone call to Bonnie and a few revisions later, Sarah saved the final version of her letter and began printing out copies for every former camper, every quilt guild that had invited Sylvia to speak, and everyone in Sylvia's address book, hastily borrowed for the cause. She needed to refill the paper tray twice and replace the toner cartridge before the last letter emerged from the printer. Summer seemed to think they would receive dozens of blocks, but Sarah was less certain. Quilters were generous, helpful people, but they also tended to be quite busy. For all their good intentions, most might not be able to contribute a block by the deadline.<br><br>With all those hundreds of requests, surely they would receive the 140 blocks Bonnie had calculated they would need for a queen-size comforter. As Sarah affixed stamps to the envelopes, listening carefully for Sylvia's footsteps in the hall outside the library, she reflected that they might be fortunate to settle for a ninety-six-block lap quilt.<br><br>The bridal quilt was Sarah's idea, but the other Elm Creek Quilters were just as enthusiastic about the project -- even Diane, who now only rarely complained about having to return the "perfect summer dress" she had purchased for the anticipated June wedding. Sylvia was the heart and soul of Elm Creek Quilt Camp, the business the eight friends had founded, jointly owned, and operated each year from spring to autumn, and not only because Elm Creek Manor was her ancestral home. Sylvia's passion for the artistic, historical, and social aspects of quilting so permeated the quilting retreat that the campers felt her influence in every class, every lecture, and every late-night chat with new friends that took place within the manor's gray stone walls. She had earned the respect, admiration, and affection of every quilter who had passed through the doors of Elm Creek Manor, yet she alone seemed unaware of this. Whenever Sarah tried to explain, as she did on each anniversary of the founding of Elm Creek Quilts, Sylvia cut her off and dismissed her praise as "preposterous." This bridal quilt would finally tell Sylvia what she would not allow Sarah to say.<br><br>To Sarah's delight, the first quilt block arrived only a week after the letters went out. The next day, Bonnie phoned with news that two more blocks had come in the morning mail, and after that, packages came so frequently that Bonnie stopped calling to report them. When she offered to bring them to their upcoming business meeting, Sarah couldn't resist. She and Bonnie told all the Elm Creek Quilters except Sylvia to meet in the kitchen thirty minutes early. Sarah figured that would give them plenty of time to examine the blocks, read the accompanying letters, and return the packages to Bonnie's car before Sylvia expected them in the formal parlor.<br><br>That Thursday evening, Bonnie arrived first, hustling through the back door and into the kitchen with a Grandma's Attic shopping bag in her arms. "Maybe this was a mistake," she said as Sarah eagerly took the bag and set it on the long wooden table in the center of the room. Bonnie shrugged off her coat and sat down on one of the benches. "All Sylvia has to do is look out the window at the parking lot and she'll know we're here."<br><br>"Sylvia's room faces the front of the manor," Sarah reminded her, emptying the bag onto the table. "It's twenty degrees outside, so the windows are shut and the furnace is running. She won't hear the cars pull up."<br><br>Bonnie raked her fingers through her close-cropped dark hair and glanced at the doorway. "Even so, we should keep our voices down."<br><br>"We're here," Diane sang, strolling into the kitchen, her blond curls bouncing. "Do we have to wait for everyone or can we see the blocks now?"<br><br>"Diane, hush, dear," warned white-haired Agnes, following close behind. Her blue eyes were exasperated behind pink-tinted glasses. "Stealth, remember?"<br><br>"She's about as stealthy as a thirsty elephant at the only waterhole on the savanna," remarked Gwen, peering in over Diane's shoulder. "You're also blocking the doorway."<br><br>"Well, excuse me, professor," Diane shot back, but she took a seat beside Sarah and reached for the envelope on top of the pile.<br><br>"Is Summer coming?" Sarah asked Gwen as she helped Agnes with her coat. "I sent her an email, but she didn't write back."<br><br>"Who knows what my daughter's up to anymore?" said Gwen. "I've had more meaningful conversations with her answering machine than with her lately."<br><br>"Summer has already seen most of the blocks at the quilt shop," said Bonnie. "But I'm sure she'll be here for the meeting."<br><br>"Summer never misses them," added Judy as she hurried into the kitchen, removing her gloves. "Unlike some of us. I honestly didn't think I'd make it tonight. When did juggling the schedules of two parents and an eight-year-old become so complicated?"<br><br>"When was it not?" asked Bonnie.<br><br>Sarah glanced at her watch and opened an envelope. "Let's keep an eye on the time, everyone."<br><br>"And keep one ear pointed toward the door," added Judy.<br><br>They agreed in whispers and soon were engrossed in passing the blocks around the table, praising them in hushed voices, silently reading the letters their makers had sent. Little Giant, Mother's Favorite, Three Cheers, Trip Around the World -- the blocks were as imaginative and as varied as the women who had made them; while Sarah usually couldn't decipher the hidden meaning at first glance, the letters never failed to explain what the blocks represented. Sarah's favorite was a Spinning Hourglass block, which the maker wrote was inspired by a conversation she and Sylvia had participated in over dinner one evening at camp. One of the women at the table had complained that she never had time to quilt at home and had to cram an entire year's worth of quilting into the one week each summer she spent at Elm Creek Manor. "We make time for the things that are important to us," Sylvia had remarked, and she listed several activities people typically participated in out of habit rather than necessity or enjoyment.<br><br>The writer said that Sylvia's words resonated with her and when she returned home, she scrutinized her routine to see where she could make better use of her days. After cutting out mindless television watching and delegating some household chores to her husband and teenage sons, she found several hours each week that she could devote to her own interests, including quilting. "Sylvia showed me that although we never have enough time for all the things we want to do," she concluded, "if we simplify our busy lives, we can keep them from spinning out of our control."<br><br>Sarah tucked the block and letter back into the envelope, ruefully running through her mental checklist of daily activities and wondering which she could sacrifice.<br><br>"Sarah?" called a distant voice. "Where is everyone?"<br><br>They scrambled up from the benches. "Quick," Gwen hissed, but the others were already returning the quilt blocks and letters to their envelopes and tossing them into the bag.<br><br>"Someone stall her," whispered Sarah frantically just as someone thrust the bag into her arms.<br><br>"Sarah?" Sylvia's voice came louder now, her footfalls swiftly approaching. "I don't have time for hide-and-seek."<br><br>Sarah flung open the pantry. She threw the bag inside and slammed the door just as Sylvia entered the kitchen.<br><br>"Sarah -- " Sylvia stopped short in the doorway and eyed the gathering. "Well, for goodness' sakes. Why are you here so early?" She fixed her gaze on Sarah. "And why are you clinging to that door for dear life?"<br><br>"Because -- " Sarah opened the door and retrieved the first item her hand touched. "They came early to help me make brownies. I was just getting the mix. Do you know if we have eggs? I was going to stop at the store, but -- "<br><br>"You need six people to make brownies?"<br><br>"Sarah's never been much of a cook," offered Diane.<br><br>"Nonsense," said Sylvia, and gestured to the cellophane-wrapped plate on the counter. "She made lemon squares this morning."<br><br>"Should we get started?" asked Judy, reaching for an apron hanging on a peg beside the pantry door.<br><br>"Don't be ridiculous," said Sylvia, glancing at the clock. "We have a lot to cover tonight. We shouldn't waste time preparing extraneous desserts."<br><br>"Chocolate is never extraneous," said Gwen, but the others quickly agreed with Sylvia, eager to get her out of the kitchen.<br><br>They gathered in the formal parlor, where the original west wing of Elm Creek Manor intersected the south wing, added when Sylvia's father was a boy. The antique Victorian furnishings might have seemed stuffy if they were not so comfortably worn. Sylvia had once mentioned that her paternal grandmother had brought the overstuffed sofas, embroidered armchairs, beaded lamps, and ornate cabinets to Elm Creek Manor upon her marriage to David Bergstrom. No one else in the family had cared for the young bride's tastes, so they had arranged the furniture in a spare room and proclaimed it too fine for everyday use. Thus the newest member of the family had not felt slighted, and the Bergstroms were able to keep the west sitting room, their preferred place for quilting and visiting, exactly as it was. In more recent decades, the Bergstroms had grown more fond of the room, but even now the only nod to modernity was a large television in the corner, concealed by a Grandmother's Fan quilt whenever it was not in use.<br><br>Sarah began the meeting with an update on registration for the coming season. Enrollment was up fifteen percent, and there were so many requests for Gwen's Photo Transfer workshop that they had decided to add a second weekly session. "If you're up for it," added Sarah, glancing at Gwen.<br><br>Gwen shrugged. "Why not? Once the spring semester ends, I'll have plenty of time."<br><br>"Bonnie, I also thought we should add a few extra shuttles into town so campers can shop," Sarah continued. "Since they'll want to visit Grandma's Attic, we'll arrange them for when you can be fully staffed, okay? I wouldn't want one person to get swamped."<br><br>"Oh. Great." Bonnie hesitated. "Do you need to know the best times of the day now? Because I'm not really sure -- "<br><br>"Just get back to me whenever you know." Sarah gave Bonnie an encouraging smile. She knew the quilt shop owner appreciated the extra business Elm Creek Quilt Camp sent her way, but she always seemed embarrassed by it, as if she thought she was taking advantage of their friendship. "You'll probably want your camp course schedule first."<br><br>Bonnie nodded, so Sarah glanced at her notes. "Oh. One more thing. This goes for everyone. Please remember to charge anything you use in your classes to supplies, not overhead. If we ever get audited -- "<br><br>"I'm here," said Summer, rushing in red-cheeked from the cold and struggling out of her coat. "I'm sorry I'm late."<br><br>"Relax," said Diane. "This isn't the first time."<br><br>"Yes, but your tardiness has been increasing lately," mused Sylvia. "I can't imagine what has been keeping you so busy."<br><br>Summer draped her coat over the back of a chair and sat down. "What did I miss?"<br><br>"Sorry, Sylvia," said Judy with a laugh. "I don't think Summer wants to discuss her boyfriend."<br><br>Everyone except Summer laughed, but she managed a wry smile. "Fine. I was having supper with Jeremy. Satisfied?"<br><br>"You guys spend so much time together you might as well live together," said Diane.<br><br>"Don't suggest such a thing," protested Agnes. She patted Summer's hand. "She meant after you get married, dear."<br><br>Summer blanched, and Gwen said, "Married? Are you crazy? Don't go putting thoughts of marriage in my daughter's head. Or of living together. My daughter has more sense than that."<br><br>"As a newlywed myself, I object to the implications of that remark," retorted Sylvia. "Sometimes getting married makes perfect sense."<br><br>Agnes nodded, but Bonnie said, "Sometimes marriage makes no sense at all."<br><br>"Can we please get back to business?" begged Summer, throwing Sarah a pleading look.<br><br>Sarah promptly returned to her agenda despite grumbles from Diane, who apparently found teasing Summer far more interesting.<br><br>Midway through the meeting, Sylvia offered to return to the kitchen for refreshments, but Bonnie leapt to her feet and announced that it was her turn. She returned with the lemon squares, coffee, and a look of relief so plain that Sarah knew the quilt blocks were safely hidden away in her car.<br><br>That night, as Sarah and her husband prepared for bed, she told him about the afternoon's mishap. Matt laughed and said, "Why didn't you just go to Grandma's Attic and look at the blocks there?"<br><br>"Because every time I say I'm going downtown, Sylvia asks to come with me. I can't very well ask her to stay in the van while I go into the quilt shop."<br><br>"No, I guess not," Matt acknowledg...</p><h2>The Holy Geeta</h2><p>The Bhagavad Geeta is universally known and Swmi Chinmayananda during his life time had given a number of lectures on the Holy Book of Hindus. These commentaries have been compiled into the present book form The popuarity of the book is great it underwent ten re-prints covering over a lakh of copies.</p><p>Swami Chinmayananda (May 8, 1916 - Aug 3, 1993) was born Balakrishna Menon (Balan) in Ernakulam, Kerala in a devout Hindu noble family called &#34;Poothampalli&#34;. Graduating from Lucknow University, he entered the field of journalism where he felt he could influence political, economic and social reform in India. But his life was changed when he met Swami Sivananda at Rishikesh and became interested in the Hindu spiritual path. [1] Balakrishna Menon took sanyas(monkhood) from Swami Sivananda and was given the name Swami Chinmayananda - the one who is saturated in Bliss and pure Consciousness. Swami Shivananda saw further potential in Swami Chinmayananda and sent him to study under a guru in the Himalayas - Swami Tapovan Maharaj under whom he studied for 8 years. Swami Tapovan maharaj was known for his rigid teaching style, to the point where he told Sw. Chinmayananda that he would only say everything once, and at anytime he would ask questions to him. Even with these extreme terms, Sw. Chinmayananda stayed with Tapovan maharaj until the very end of 8 years. Being a journalist at heart, Sw. Chinmayananda wanted to make this pure knowledge available to all people of all backgrounds, even though Tapovan Maharaj had advised against it. It was then that with Tapovan maharaj&#39;s blessings, he left the Himalayas to teach the world the knowledge of Vedanta throughout the world. During his forty years of travelling and teaching, Swami Chinmayananda opened numerous centres and ashrams worldwide, he also built many schools, hospitals, nursing homes and clinics. His interest in helping the villagers with basic necessities lead to the eventual creation of a rural development project, known as the Chinmaya Organization for Rural Development or CORD. It&#39;s Naitonal Director, Dr. Kshama Metre was recently awarded the Padma Shree National award in Social Work. Swami Chinmayananda passed away on 3 August 1993 in San Diego, California. His followers regard him as having attained Mahasamadhi at that point. His work has resulted in the creation of an international organization called Chinmaya Mission. This mission serves Swami Chinmayananda&#39;s vision of reinvigorating India&#39;s rich cultural heritage, and making Vedanta accessible to everybody regardless of age, nationality, or religious background.</p><h2>Block Magic: Over 50 Fun &amp; Easy Blocks from Squares and Rectangles</h2><p>Nancy blazes new trails in block design using the 2 easiest shapes in quilting!

For the wisecracking millionaire attorney suffering from "lawyer's block," the case looks like a no-brainer, until the cops pick up another suspect: Andy's lead P.I., Laurie Collins, who happens to be the love of his life. Soon Laurie's case is looking bleak and Andy is becoming increasingly desperate. All he had wanted was a case to sink his teeth into. Now he gets one that's a kick in the head . . . and the heart.</p><p>DAVID ROSENFELT is the former marketing president for Tri-Star Pictures and lives in Southern California.Clever plot twists, deft legal maneuverings and keen wit boost Rosenfelt's accomplished follow-up to his Edgar-nominated debut, Open and Shut (2002). Newly wealthy and no longer in need of cases to sustain his legal practice, Paterson, N.J., attorney Andy Carpenter is free to pick and choose his clients. The glib, amiable Andy certainly would not choose the character who comes into his office confessing to the grisly murder of corrupt police officer Alex Dorsey. The bad end of a bad cop has almost endless ramifications. After successfully dealing with one complication arising from this surprising visit, Andy is faced with an even worse one when his lover, PI Laurie Collins, winds up accused of Dorsey's murder. As the net of overwhelming circumstantial evidence tightens around Laurie during the judicial process, every lead Andy and his team pursue seems to result in either a death or a dead end.

I'm lying spread-eagle on my back, ankles and wrists tied tightly to the bedposts so that I can't pull them free. </p> <p> A woman is crying beside me. I've been kidnapped. </p> <p> My name is Carl. </p> <p> But there's more that I know about myself, fragments that don't quite make sense. Pieces of a puzzle forced into place. I know that I'm a quarter inch shy of six feet tall and that my physical conditioning has been stretched to its limits. I have a son whom I love more than my own life and a wife named . . . named Kelly, of course, Kelly. How could I hesitate on that one? I'm unconscious or asleep, yes, but how could I ever misplace my wife's name? </p> <p> I was born in New York and joined the army when I was eighteen. Special Forces at age twenty, now twenty-five. My father left home when I was eight, and I took care of three younger sisters--Eve, Ashley, Pearl--and my mother, Betty Strople, who was always proud of me for being such a strong boy. When I was fourteen, Brad Stenko slapped my mother. I hit him over the head with a two-by-four and called the police. I remember his name because his intent to marry my mother terrified me. I remember things like that. Events and facts cemented into place by pain. </p> <p> My wife's name is Kelly. See, I know that, I really do. And my son's name is Matthew. Matt. Matt and Kelly, right? </p> <p> I'm a prisoner. A woman is crying beside me. </p> <p><em> &nbsp;</em></p> <p><em> &nbsp;</em></p> <p> Carl snapped his eyes wide open, stared into the white light above him, and closed his eyes again. </p> <p> Opening his eyes had been a mistake that could have alerted anyone watching to his awakening. He scrambled for orientation. In that brief moment, eyes opened wide to the ceiling, his peripheral vision had seen the plain room. Smudged white walls. Natural light from a small window. A single fluorescent fixture above, a dirty mattress under him. </p> <p> And the crying woman, strapped down beside him. </p> <p> Otherwise the room appeared empty. If there was any immediate danger, he hadn't seen it. So it was safe to open his eyes. </p> <p> Carl did, quickly confirmed his estimation of the room, then glanced down at a thick red nylon cord bound around each ankle and tied to two metal bedposts. Beside him, the woman was strapped down in similar manner. </p> <p> His black dungarees had been shoved up to his knees. No shoes. The woman's left leg lay over his right and was strapped to the same post. Her legs had been cut and bruised, and the cord was tied tightly enough around her ankles to leave marks. She wore a pleated navy-blue skirt, torn at the hem, and a white blouse that looked as if it had been dragged through a field with her. </p> <p> This was Kelly. He knew that, and he knew that he cared for Kelly deeply, but he was suddenly unsure why. He blinked, searching his memory for details, but his memory remained fractured. Perhaps his captors had used drugs. </p> <p> The woman whose name was Kelly faced the ceiling, eyes closed. Her tears left streaks down dirty cheeks and into short blond hair. Small nose, high cheekbones, a bloody nose. Several scratches on her forehead. </p> <p><em> I'm strapped to a bed next to a woman named Kelly who's been brutalized. My name is Carl and I should feel panic, but I feel nothing</em> . </p> <p> The woman suddenly caught her breath, jerked her head to face him, and stared into his soul with wide blue eyes. </p> <p> In the space of one breath, Carl's world changed. Like a heat wave vented from a sauna, emotion swept over him. A terrible wave of empathy laced with a bitterness he couldn't understand. But he understood that he cared for the woman behind these blue eyes very much. </p> <p> And then, as quickly as the feeling had come, it fell away. </p> <p> "Carl . . ." Her face twisted with anguish. Fresh tears flooded her eyes and ran down her left cheek. </p> <p> "Kelly?" </p> <p> She began to speak in a frantic whisper. "We have to get out of here! They're going to kill us." Her eyes darted toward the door. "We have to do something before he comes back. He's going to kill . . ." Her voice choked on tears. </p> <p> Carl's mind refused to clear. He knew who she was, who he was, why he cared for her, but he couldn't readily access that knowledge. Worse, he didn't seem capable of emotion, not for more than a few seconds. </p> <p> "Who . . . who are you?" </p> <p> She blinked, as if she wasn't sure she'd heard him right. "What did they do to you?" </p> <p> He didn't know. They'd hurt him, he knew that. Who were they? Who was she? </p> <p> She spoke urgently through her tears. "I'm your wife! We were on vacation, at port in Istanbul when they took us. Three days ago. They . . . I think they took Matthew. Don't tell me you can't remember!" </p> <p> Details that he'd rehearsed in his mind before waking flooded him. He was with the army, Special Forces. His family had been taken by force from a market in Istanbul. Matthew was their son. Kelly was his wife. </p> <p> Panicked, Carl jerked hard against the restraints. He was rewarded with a squealing metal bed frame, no more. </p> <p> Another mistake. Whoever had the resources to kidnap them undoubtedly had the foresight to use the right restraints. He was reacting impulsively rather than with calculation. Carl closed his eyes and calmed himself. <em>Focus, you have to focus</em>. </p> <p> "They brought you in here unconscious half an hour ago and gave you a shot." Her words came out in a rush. "I think . . . I'm pretty sure they want you to kill someone." Her fingers touched the palm of his hand above their heads. Clasped his wrist. "I'm afraid, Carl. I'm so afraid." Crying again. </p> <p> "Please, Kelly. Slow down." </p> <p> "Slow down? I've been tied to this bed for three days! I thought you were dead! They took our son!" </p> <p> The room faded and then came back into focus. They stared at each other for a few silent seconds. There was something strange about her eyes. He was remembering scant details of their kidnapping, even fewer details of their life together, but her eyes were a window into a world that felt familiar and right. </p> <p> They had Matthew. Rage began to swell, but he cut it off and was surprised to feel it wane. His training was kicking in. He'd been trained not to let feelings cloud his judgment. So then his not feeling was a good thing. </p> <p> "I need you to tell me what you know." </p> <p> "I've told you. We were on a cruise--" </p> <p> "No, everything. Who we are, how we were taken. What's happened since we arrived. Everything." </p> <p> "What did they do to you?" </p> <p> "I'm okay. I just can't remember--" </p> <p> "You're bleeding." She stared at the base of his head. "Your hair . . ." </p> <p> He felt no pain, no wetness from blood. He lifted his head and twisted it for a look at the mattress under his hair. A fist-sized red blotch stained the cover. </p> <p> The pain came then, a deep, throbbing ache at the base of his skull. He laid his head back down and stared at the ceiling. With only a little effort he disconnected himself from the pain. </p> <p> "Tell me what you remember." </p> <p> She blinked, breathed deliberately, as if she might forget to if she didn't concentrate. "You had a month off from your post in Kuwait and we decided to take a cruise to celebrate our seventh anniversary. Matthew was buying some crystallized ginger when a man grabbed him and went into an alley between the tents. You went after him. I saw someone hit you from behind with a metal pipe. Then a rag with some kind of chemical was clamped over my face and I passed out. Today's the first time I've seen you." She closed her eyes. "They tortured me, Carl." </p> <p> Anger rose, but again he suppressed it. Not now. There would be time for anger later, if they survived. </p> <p> His head seemed to be clearing. More than likely they'd kept him drugged for days, and whatever they'd put into his system half an hour ago was waking him up. That would explain his temporary memory loss. </p> <p> "What nationality are they?" </p> <p> "Hungarian, I think. The one named Dale is a sickening . . ." She stopped, but the look of hatred in her eyes spoke plenty. </p> <p> Carl blocked scattered images of all the possible things Dale might have done to her. Again, that he was able to do this so easily surprised him. Was he so insensitive to his own wife? </p> <p> No, he was brutally efficient. For her sake he had to be. </p> <p> Their captors had left their mouths free--if he could find a way to reach their restraints . . . </p> <p> The door swung open. A man with short-cropped blond hair stepped into the room. Medium height. Knifelike nose and chin. Fiercely eager blue eyes. Khaki cotton pants, black shirt, hairy arms. Dale. </p> <p> Carl knew this man. </p> <p> This was Dale Crompton. This was a man who'd spent some time in the dark spaces of Carl's mind, securing Carl's hatred. Kelly had said Hungarian, but she must have meant someone else, because Dale was an Englishman. </p> <p> The man's right arm hung by his side, hand snugged around an Eastern Bloc Makarov 9mm pistol. The detail was brightly lit in Carl's mind while other details remained stubbornly shrouded by darkness. He knew his weapons. </p> <p> Without any warning or fanfare, Dale rounded the foot of the bed, pressed the barrel of the Makarov against Kelly's right thigh, and pulled the trigger. </p> <p> The gun bucked with a thunderclap. Kelly arched her back, screamed, and thrashed against her restraints, then dropped to the mattress in a faint. </p> <p> Carl's mind passed the threshold of whatever training he'd received. His mind demanded he feel nothing, lie uncaring in the face of brutal manipulation, but his body had already begun its defense of his wife. He snarled and bolted up, oblivious to the pain in his wrists and ankles. </p> <p> The movement proved useless. He might as well be a dog on a thick chain, jerked violently back at the end of a sprint for freedom. </p> <p> He collapsed back onto the bed and gathered himself. Kelly lay still. A single glance told him that the bullet had expended its energy without passing through her leg, which meant it had struck the femur, probably shattering it. </p> <p> "I hope I have your attention," Dale said. "Her leg will heal. A similar bullet to her head, on the other hand, will produce far more satisfying results. I'd love to kill her. And your son. What is his name? Matthew?" </p> <p> Carl just stared at him. <em>Focus. Believe. You must believe in your ability to save them. </em></p> <p> "Pity to destroy such a beautiful woman," Dale said, walking to the window. "Just so you know, I argued to tie your son next to you and keep Kelly for other uses, but Kalman overruled me. He says the boy will be useful if you fail us the first time." </p> <p> Englishman put the gun on the sill, unlatched the window, and pulled it up. Fresh breezes carried a lone bird's chirping into the room. <em>It's spring. I can smell fresh grass and spring flowers. I can smell fresh blood.</em></p> <p> Englishman faced him. "A simple and quite lethal device has been surgically implanted at the base of your hypothalamus gland. This explains the bleeding at the back of your head. Any attempt to remove this device will result in the release of chemicals that will destroy your brain within ten seconds. Your life is in our hands. Is this clear?" </p> <p> The revelation struck Carl as perfectly natural. Exactly what he would have expected, knowing what he did, whatever that was. </p> <p> "Yes." </p> <p> "Good. Your mission is to kill a man and his wife currently housed in a heavily guarded hotel at the edge of the town directly to our south, three miles away. Joseph and Mary Fabin will be in their room on the third floor. Number 312. No one else is to be killed. Only the targets. You have two cartridges in the gun, only two. No head shots. We need their faces for television. Do you understand?" </p> <p> A wave of dizziness swept through Carl. Aside from a slight tic in his right eye, he showed none of it. Beside him, Kelly moaned. How could he ignore his wife's suffering so easily? </p> <p> Carl eyed the pistol on the sill. "I understand." </p> <p> "We will watch you closely. If you make any contact with the authorities, your wife will die. If you step outside the mission parameters, she dies. If you haven't returned within sixty minutes, both she and your son will die. Do you understand?" </p> <p> Carl spoke quickly to cover any fear in his eyes. "The name of the hotel?" </p> <p> "The Andrassy," Dale said. He withdrew a knife from his waistband, walked over to Carl, and laid the sharp edge against the red nylon rope that tied Carl's right leg to the bed frame. </p> <p> "I'm sure you would like to kill me," Dale said. "This is impossible, of course. But if you try, you, your wife, and your son will be dead within the minute." </p> <p> "Who are the targets?" </p> <p> "They are the two people who can save your wife and son by dying within the hour." The man cut through the bonds around Carl's ankles, then casually went to work on the rope at his wrists. "You'll find some shoes and clean clothes outside the window." With a faint <em>pop,</em> the last tie yielded to Englishman's blade. </p> <p> Kelly whimpered, and Carl looked over to see that her eyes were open again. Face white, muted by horror and pain. </p> <p> For a long moment, lying there freed beside the woman he loved, Carl allowed a terrible fury to roll through his mind. Despite Dale's claim, Carl knew that he stood at least an even chance of killing their captor. </p> <p> He wanted to touch Kelly and to tell her that she would be okay. That he would save her and their son. He wanted to tear the heart out of the man who was now watching them with a dispassionate stare, like a robot assigned to a simple task. </p> <p> He wanted to scream. He wanted to cry. He wanted to kill himself. </p> <p> Instead, he lay still. </p> <p> Kelly closed her eyes and started to sob again. He wished she would stop. He wanted to shout at her and demand that she stop this awful display of fear. Didn't she know that fear was now their greatest enemy? </p> <p> "Fifty-eight minutes," Dale said. "It's quite a long run." </p> <p> Carl slid his legs off the bed, stood, and walked to the window, thinking that he was a monster for being so callous, never mind that it was for her sake that he steeled himself. </p> <p><em> I'm in a nightmare</em> . He reached for the gun. But the Makarov's cold steel handle felt nothing like a dream. It felt like salvation. </p> <p> "Carl?" </p> <p> Kelly's voice shattered his reprieve. Carl was sure that he would spin where he stood, shoot Dale through the forehead, and take his chances with the implant or whatever other means they had of killing him and his family. The only way he knew to deal with such a compelling urge was to shut down his emotions entirely. He clenched his jaw and shoved the gun into his waistband. </p> <p> "I love you, Carl." </p> <p> He looked at her without seeing her, swallowed his terror. "It'll be okay," he said. "I'll be back." </p> <p> He grabbed both sides of the window, thrust his head out to scan the grounds, withdrew, shoved his right leg through the opening, and rolled onto the grass outside. When he came to his feet, he was facing south. How did he know it was south? He just did. </p> <p> He would go south and he would kill. </p></p><h2>Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo [Hardcover]</h2><p>Used.

IP.</p><p>Ferrol Sams is a physician, humorist, storyteller, and the bestselling author of eight novels rooted in the oral tradition of southern humor and folklore. He lives in Fayetteville, Georgia.In 1982, when he was 58, Georgia physician Sams published his first novel, Run with the Horsemen, to critical acclaim. Six books later, here's a collection of three long, rather philosophical stories that, although by no means flawless, exhibit the same wisdom and command of language as his earlier works. On the surface, the title story is an engaging tale about a quixotic old doctor battling the harassment of a pompous young medical bureaucrat while trying to treat the blood pressure of a simple working man too proud to ask help from anyone. A deepening relationship between doctor and patient evolves, allowing for the unfolding of a complex secondary story about injustice and racism. Ultimately, the perspectives of both men are profoundly changed. The middle story, "Harmony Ain't Easy," examines the mettle-and enduring resources-of a 40-year marriage against the background of a wildflower-hunting expedition in the remote Georgia mountains that suddenly takes a harrowing turn. In the concluding story, "Relative &amp; Absolute," a trio of high-school seniors, for a class project, interview the town's oldest citizen about the not-so-good old days. While each tale is more than a bit preachy and burdened by long stretches of dialogue, all three are filled with warm insights and piquant questions about our inhumanity to one another. The homespun result is both satisfying and provoking-and well worth the read. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Into Temptation (Lytton Family Trilogy)</h2><p><p><strong>An enthralling epic of the glamorous life in the mid-20th century with scenery that extends from New York to London, Into Temptation gives apt and telling insights into the world of the British aristocracy and their literary legacy.</strong></p> Into Temptation, the third book of the Lytton family trilogy, shifts the focus to New York City and Barty Miller.

Going through a tunnel, encountering an angelic being or having an out-of-body experience are hallmarks of what Moody termed a 'near death experience.' Since the publication of his multimillion copy best-seller, hundreds of thousands of people have contacted Moody to share their own experiences. The startling pattern that Moody discovered is that at the time of death, loved ones also have inexplicable experiences. <i><b>Glimpses of Eternity</b></i> is the first book to talk about the phenomenon of 'shared death experiences.' Readers will discover deathbed moments when entire families see the light or the room changes shape. Others tell of seeing a film like review of a loved one's life and learning things that they could never have known otherwise. The stories are at once a comfort and a mystery, giving us a new understanding of the journey that we will take at the end of our lives.</p><p><b>Dr. Raymond Moody</b> is the leading authority on the 'near death experience,' a phrase he coined in the late seventies. Best-selling author of eleven books, including <i>Life After Life</i>, which has sold more than 13 million copies worldwide, Dr. Moody captures enormous public interest with his groundbreaking work on what happens when we die. He has appeared on <i>Oprah</i> three times and the <i>Today Show</i>, among many other media appearances.If you know anything about near-death experience, you know Moody; he&#x2019;s been on the cutting edge of the research since the publication of his first book, Life after Life (1975). Now he takes the phenomenon to another level. In the 1980s, Moody began hearing about shared-death experiences; friends, family, and medical personal go along with the dying as they are surrounded by the light, taken through the tunnel, and sometimes even take part in the life review. Most of the book comprises firsthand accounts that tell a common story. Then Moody takes on some of the most-asked questions raised by the idea of shared-death experiences: Do they tell us something new about the afterlife? Do you have to be religious to have the experience? How do you know people who claim to have had shared-death experiences aren&#x2019;t lying? Moody also theorizes on what might explain these experiences and how shared-death experiences might be the ancient basis for religion. Nonbelievers will scoff, but as Moody notes, &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s good for mankind to have a hearty dose of the unexplained.&#x201d; --Ilene Cooper</p><h2>Pilgrims in the Kingdom: Travels in Christian Britain</h2><p>Book by Douglas, David, Douglas, Deborah Smith</p><p></p><h2>Treatise on the Spleen and Stomach: A Translation of the Pi Wei Lun</h2><p>This is a translation and annotation of Li Dong-yuan&#39;s Pi Wei Lun; by Bob Flaws.

Masterful craftsmanship and aesthetic sensitivity evolved with this furniture's long history. Yet, as with much that is Japanese, these pieces find virtue in restraint. The work is compelling yet sedate, with an understated simplicity distilled from a thousand years of knowledge and careful craftsmanship. <br><br>Though the West has long acknowledged the beauty and value of these objects, the history of their making--their milieu and craftsmanship-remain virtually unexplored. This volume, first published in 1986, fills that void. Author Kazuko Koizumi, a pioneer in the field, brings a thoroughness and warmth to the subject. A wealth of illustrated material puts the pieces in context. A historical account, laced with centuries-old drawings, traces the evolution of furniture design through the lens of Japan's "floor-based" culture. <br><br>With 114 color plates and over 650 figures, <em>Traditional Japanese Furniture</em> documents and discusses the roots of more than eighty unique furniture types, including the many variations of the beloved tansu chest that has made its way into homes and museums around the world. Like many of the objects it portrays, <em>Traditional Japanese Furniture</em> has found its place among collectors and enthusiasts, standing today as the definitive volume on the subject.</p><p><br>KAZUKO KOIZUMI has been a leading scholar of traditional furniture for decades, almost single-handedly reviving the study of these traditional objects. Now a recognized authority, Koizumi's pioneering research and publications have led to a reevaluation of Japanese furniture among her colleagues, and given it new meaning in the eyes of her fellow citizens.<br>Text: English, Japanese</p><h2>Acts of Meaning (Four Lectures on Mind and Culture - Jerusalem-Harvard Lectures)</h2><p>Jerome Bruner argues that the cognitive revolution, with its current fixation on mind as &#34;information processor;&#34; has led psychology away from the deeper objective of understanding mind as a creator of meanings. Only by breaking out of the limitations imposed by a computational model of mind can we grasp the special interaction through which mind both constitutes and is constituted by culture.</p><p><b>Jerome Bruner</b> is University Professor at New York University and the author of many books, including <i>Acts of Meaning</i>; <i>On Knowing</i>; <i>The Process of Education</i>; and <i>Toward a Theory of Instruction</i> (all published by Harvard).The failure of the cognitive revolution to unravel the mysteries of the workings of the human mind as the creator of meanings is the starting point for Jerome Bruner's <i>Acts of Meaning</i>. He argues that psychology should return to human concerns, especially the role of culture in shaping our thoughts and the language we use to express them...[He] seems to have read and assimilated everyone else's ideas on the topics he discusses. He can--and does--allude to them in context, so that we are constantly rubbing elbows with the giants on whose shoulders he stands. Erudite and recondite, the text glistens with Bruner's bold style.

Now, a quarter century after "The Joke" was first published and several years after the collapse of the Soviet-imposed Czechoslovak regime, it becomes easier to put such implications into perspective in favor of valuing the book (and all Kundera 's work) as what it truly is: great, stirring literature that sheds new light on the eternal themes of human existence. <p>The present edition provides English-language readers an important further means toward revaluation of "The Joke." For reasons he describes in his Author's Note, Milan Kundera devoted much time to creating (with the assistance of his American publisher-editor) a completely revised translation that reflects his original as closely as any translation possibly can: reflects it in its fidelity not only to the words and syntax but also to the characteristic dictions and tonalities of the novel's narrators. The result is nothing less than the restoration of a classic.</p>The French-Czech novelist Milan Kundera was born in the Czech Republic and has lived in France since 1975. He is the author of the internationally acclaimed and bestselling novels The Joke, Life is Elsewhere, The Farewell Waltz, The Book of Laughter and Forgetting, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Immortality, and the short-story collection Laughable Loves -- all originally in Czech. His more recent novels , Slowness, Identity, and Ignorance, as well as his nonfiction works, The Art of the Novel, Testaments Betrayed, The Curtain, and Encounter, were originally written in French.</p><h2>The Holy Land: An Armchair Pilgrimage</h2><p>What&#x2019;s the next best thing to going on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land with Fr.

She is also the author of <i>Heart to Heart: New Poems Inspired by Twentieth-Century American Art</i>, named a Michael L. Printz Honor Book by the American Library Association. Greenberg lives in St. Louis.Grade 5-8-Greenberg's exploration of Bearden's art is filled with large, full-color reproductions, primarily of his mature works. The illustrations occasionally fill an entire page, and give readers an excellent overview of Bearden's style and subject matter. Some photographs of the artist are included as well. Using the collages and lithographs to reveal biographical snippets and memories results in disjointed and choppy text, both in sentence structure and in subject matter. The author hops around from one point to another with little warning or set up. Her admiration for her subject comes across clearly: "When we look at his paintings, we feel we could be right there with him running through a cotton field in North Carolina or sitting on the front stoop of a tenement in Harlem." The time line includes some new research, most notably that Bearden graduated from New York University with a degree in education, when previous accounts cited his degree as in mathematics. However, the date of his marriage to Nanette Rohan is given as 1951, when it was actually 1954. The pagination is also problematic, citing the wrong pages for quotes within the book. Also, there is nothing within the text of the book to indicate that a further explanation of a quote or definition of a term is located in the notes or glossary. Still, for its illustrations alone, schools or libraries with a high interest in art may wish to purchase this book.<br><i>Heather E.

There have been books that describe and evaluate Chandler&#x2019;s life, but to find out what he himself felt about his life and work, Barry Day, editor of <i>The</i> <i>Letters of No�l Coward </i>(&#x201c;There is much to dazzle here in just the way we expect . . . the book is meticulous, artfully structured&#x2014;splendid&#x201d; &#x2014;Daniel Mendelsohn; <i>The New York Review of Books</i>), has cannily, deftly chosen from Chandler&#x2019;s writing, as well as the many interviews he gave over the years as he achieved cult status, to weave together an illuminating narrative that reveals the man, the work, the worlds he created.<br><br>Using Chandler&#x2019;s own words as well as Day&#x2019;s text, here is the life of &#x201c;the man with no home,&#x201d; a man precariously balanced between his classical English education with its immutable values and that of a fast-evolving America during the years before the Great War, and the changing vernacular of the cultural psyche that resulted. Chandler makes clear what it is to be a writer, and in particular what it is to be a writer of &#x201c;hardboiled&#x201d; fiction in what was for him &#x201c;another language.&#x201d; Along the way, he discusses the work of his contemporaries: Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain, Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Agatha Christie, W. Somerset Maugham, and others (&#x201c;I wish,&#x201d; said Chandler, &#x201c;I had one of those facile plotting brains, like Erle Gardner&#x201d;).<br><br>Here is Chandler&#x2019;s Los Angeles (&#x201c;There is a touch of the desert about everything in California,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and about the minds of the people who live here&#x201d;), a city he adopted and that adopted him in the post-World War I period . . . Here is his Hollywood (&#x201c;Anyone who doesn&#x2019;t like Hollywood,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;is either crazy or sober&#x201d;) . . . He recounts his own (rocky) experiences working in the town with Billy Wilder, Howard Hawks, Alfred Hitchcock, and others. . .We see Chandler&#x2019;s alter ego, Philip Marlowe, private eye, the incorruptible knight with little armor who walks the &#x201c;mean streets&#x201d; in a world not made for knights (&#x201c;If I had ever an opportunity of selecting the movie actor who would best represent Marlowe to my mind, I think it would have been Cary Grant.&#x201d;) . . . Here is Chandler on drinking (his life in the end was in a race with alcohol&#x2014;and loneliness) . &nbsp;. &nbsp;. and here are Chandler&#x2019;s women&#x2014;the Little Sisters, the &#x201c;dames&#x201d; in his fiction, and in his life (on writing <i>The Long Goodbye</i>, Chandler said, &#x201c;I watched my wife die by half inches and I wrote the best book in my agony of that knowledge . . . I was as hollow as the places between the stars.&#x201d; After her death Chandler led what he called a &#x201c;posthumous life&#x201d; writing fiction, but more often than not, his writing life was made up of letters written to women he barely knew.)<br><br>Interwoven throughout the text are more than one hundred pictures that reveal the psyche and world of Raymond Chandler. &#x201c;I have lived my whole life on the edge of nothing,&#x201d; he wrote. &nbsp;In his own words, and with Barry Day&#x2019;s commentary, we see the shape this took and the way it informed the man and his extraordinary work.<br><br></p></p><p>BARRY DAY was born in England and received his M.A. from Balliol College, Oxford.

The stuff inside it is mostly junk.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Harlan Potter in <i>The Long Goodbye<br></i><br> &#x201c;a big hard-boiled city with no more personality than a paper cup.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It is the same in all big cities, amigo.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<i>The Little Sister<br></i><br> I smelled Los Angeles before I got to it. It smelled stale and old like a living room that had been closed too long. But the colored light fooled you.<br> &#x2014;<i>The Little Sister<br></i><br> Crime writer Ross Macdonald&#x2014;considered by many to be the leading neo-Chandler&#x2014;wrote that Chandler &#x201c;invested the sun-blinded streets of Los Angeles with a romantic presence.&#x201d; But the romance was strictly of the film noir variety.<br><br>It was a time when the city was trying to carve out an identity for itself. There are those who will tell you it still is. Hollywood was not the whole of Los Angeles; but in a very unreal sense, all of Los Angeles was Hollywood.<br><br>Architectural imagination ran riot. French <i>ch�teaux </i>sat cheek by jowl with Tudor castles and Italian villas. You might go to a restaurant like the Brown Derby, built to resemble a hat, or a bank that resembled an animal. A bottling plant a block long might have the exterior of an ocean liner with portholes for windows; a cinema posed as a Chinese pagoda&#x2014;and still does. Everything was made to look like something else, and nothing seemed built to last&#x2014;just like the film sets over in Hollywood.<br><br> There was money aplenty . . .<br><br> There were great silent estates, with twelve-foot walls and wrought-iron gates and ornamental hedges; and inside, if you could get inside, a special brand of sunshine, very quiet, put up in noise-proof containers just for the upper classes.<br> &#x2014;<i>Farewell, My Lovely<br></i><br> The bright gardens had a haunted look, as though wild eyes were watching . . . from behind the bushes, as though the sunshine itself had a mysterous something in the light.<br> &#x2014;<i>The Big Sleep<br></i><br> The house itself was not so much. It was smaller than Buckingham Palace, rather gray for California, and probably had fewer windows than the Chrysler Building . . . A man in a striped vest and gilt buttons opened the door, bowed, took my hat and was through for the day.<br> &#x2014;<i>Farewell, My Lovely<br></i><br> Inside the houses&#x2014;were you privileged enough to get a peep&#x2014;you were likely to find<br> the kind of room where people sit on floor cushions with their feet in their laps and sip absinthe through lumps of sugar and talk from the back of their throats in high, affected voices, and some of them just squeak. It was a room where anything could happen except work.<br> &#x2014;<i>Farewell, My Lovely<br></i><br> On the floor might be &#x201c;a rug as thin as silk and as old as Aesop&#x2019;s aunt&#x201d; (&#x201c;Mandarin&#x2019;s Jade&#x201d;) or, alternatively, &#x201c;You could just man- age to walk on the carpet without waders&#x201d; (<i>The High Window</i>). &#x201c;A peach-colored Chinese rug a gopher could have spent a week in without showing his nose above the nap&#x201d; (&#x201c;Mandarin&#x2019;s Jade&#x201d;).<br> When the old-money moment was past, the glow faded fast. The color scheme of the old Chateau Berry was&nbsp;bile green, linseed-poultice brown, sidewalk gray and monkey- bottom blue. It was as restful as a split lip.<br> &#x2014;<i>The Little Sister<br></i><br>Raymond Chandler, one gathers, did not approve of the filthy rich, if only because of what they did with their money.<br><br> Chandler remembered the city as being &#x201c;hot and dry when I first went there, with tropical rains in winter and sunshine at least nine-tenths of the year.&#x201d;<br> Marlowe also has his memories . . .<br><br> &#x201c;I used to like this town,&#x201d; I said . . . &#x201c;A long time ago. There were trees along Wilshire Boulevard. Beverly Hills was a country town. Westwood was bare hills and lots offering at eleven hundred dollars and no takers. Hollywood was a bunch of frame houses on the interurban line. Los Angeles was just a big dry sunny place with ugly homes and no style, but goodhearted and peaceful. It had the climate they just yap about now. People used to sleep out on porches. Little groups who thought they were intellectual used to call it the Athens of America. It wasn&#x2019;t that, but it wasn&#x2019;t a neon-lighted slum either.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<i>The Little Sister<br></i><br> It was a very different Los Angeles in those days. The 1911 Census had estimated 350,000 people but the trickle of immigrants was becoming a flood. By 1930 it would be 1.5 million and a lot of things would have changed.<br><br> An oil boom of massive proportions was under way, creating money and jobs&#x2014;and it didn&#x2019;t much care for whom. Money poured into the state with the encouragement of the federal government. Before long the economy was that of a fair-sized country and, since it was easy money, it easily attracted organized crime.<br><br> World War II aggravated the situation. The setting-up of factories for arms manufacturing made California the epicenter of the defense industry, and Washington&#x2014;anxious to help rebuild the region after the Depression of the 1930s&#x2014;gave preference in the granting of contracts.<br><br> And still people poured in. By the 1950s the city boasted an electronic sign that showed the population increase minute-by-minute. What it did not show was the range of problems that unplanned influx brought with it.<br><br>It was all too much too soon for a town that had no evolved culture of its own. What had emerged, Chandler saw as being just as much the product of bland mass production and advertising. He called it the &#x201c;culture of the filter-tipped cigarette . . . leading to a steakless steak to be broiled on a heatless broiler in a non-existent oven and eaten by a toothless ghost.&#x201d;<br><br>In the books Marlowe is constantly crisscrossing the terrain, noting the morphing of one aspect into another&#x2014;rarely for the better&#x2014;and always making us aware of the geographical context in which this amorphous new &#x201c;Athens&#x201d; exists. Behind it, the timeless range of mountains. Before it, &#x201c;the great fat solid Pacific trudging into shore like a scrubwoman going home . . . a California ocean. California, the department store state. The most of everything and the best of nothing&#x201d; (<i>The Little Sister</i>). &#x201c;There is a touch of the desert about every- thing in California and about the minds of the people who live here.&#x201d; (Letter to Blanche Knopf). We are constantly being made aware of natural beauty corrupted by unnatural man.<br> In more mellow mood, the sea takes on more romantic imagery . . .<br><br>Under the thinning fog the surf curled and creamed, almost without sound, like a thought trying to form itself on the edge of consciousness.<br> &#x2014;<i>The Big Sleep<br></i><br> The swell is as gentle as an old lady singing hymns.&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>The Long Goodbye</i><br> In the cove the waves don&#x2019;t break, they slide in politely, like floor walkers.<br> &#x2014;<i>Playback<br></i><br> In that mood the city itself has its own kind of beauty, though the imagery is invariably man-made: &#x201c;The lights of the city were a vast golden carpet, stitched with brilliant splashes of red and green and blue and purple&#x201d; (&#x201c;Pick-Up on Noon Street&#x201d;) . . . &#x201c;The lights of Hollywood and L.A. winked at him. Searchlight beams probed the cloudless sky as if searching for bombing planes&#x201d; (&#x201c;The King in Yel low&#x201d;) . . . &#x201c;the stars were as bright and artificial as stars of chromium on a sky of black velvet&#x201d; (<i>Farewell, My Lovely</i>) . . . &#x201c;a slanting grey rain like a swung curtain of crystal beads&#x201d; (<i>The Big Sleep</i>) . . . &#x201c;The light hit pencils of rain and made silver wires of them&#x201d; (&#x201c;The Curtain&#x201d;) . . .<br> The valley moonlight was so sharp that the black shadows looked as though they had been cut with an engraving tool . . . ten thou- sand lighted windows and the stars hanging down over them politely, not getting too close.<br> &#x2014;<i>The High Window<br></i><br> There was loneliness and the smell of kelp and the smell of wild sage from the hills. A yellow window hung here and there, all by itself, like the last orange.<br><br> &#x2014;<i>Farewell, My Lovely </i>Spring rustling in the air like a paper bag blowing along a concrete sidewalk.<br> &#x2014;<i>Farewell, My Lovely<br></i><br> We curved through the bright mile or two of the Sunset Strip past the antique shops with famous screen names on them, past the win- dows full of point lace and ancient pewter, past the gleaming new nightclubs with famous chefs and equally famous gambling rooms, run by polished graduates of the Purple Gang, past the Georgian Colonial vogue, now old hat, past the handsome modernistic buildings in which the Hollywood flesh-peddlers never stop talking money, past a drive-in lunch which somehow didn&#x2019;t belong, even though the girls wore white silk blouses and drum majorettes&#x2019; shakos and nothing below the hips but glazed Hessian boots. Past all this and down a wide smooth curve to the bridle path of Beverly Hills and lights to the south, all colors of the spectrum and crystal clear in an evening without fog, past the shadowed mansions up on the hills to the north, past Beverly Hills altogether and up into the twisting foothill boulevard and the sudden cool dusk and the drift of wind from the sea.<br> &#x2014;<i>Farewell, My Lovely<br></i><br> Beverly Hills was such a nice place before the Phoenicians took it over. Now it&#x2019;s just a setting for an enormous confidence racket.<br><br> As time&#x2014;and Marlowe&#x2014;go by, another incidental dimension emerges in Chandler&#x2019;s panorama of the city. Not only is it growing before our eyes but we are made aware of proximity. The bad and the beautiful exist literally cheek by jowl. Two blocks from obscene wealth is abject poverty. The dreams of Hollywood coexist happily with the worst urban nightmares . . . and nobody seems to notice or care too much.<br> Even Nature is not to be trusted. It&#x2019;s always lying in wait for you . . .<br><br> There was a desert wind blowing that night. It was one of those dry Santa Anas that come down through the mountain passes and curl your hair and make your nerves jump and your skin itch. On nights like that every booze party ends in a fight. Meek little wives feel the edge of the carving knife and study their husband&#x2019;s necks. Anything can happen.

Unabridged.Written as a conversational piece about the twenty-year career of Navy test pilot and astronaut Wally Schirra, this performance maintains the armchair tone and pace of what amounts to a collection of personal anecdotes. Richard Rohan handles the technical vocabulary well, making it seem as though the author himself were doing the narration. Schirra jumps around in time and space and repeats himself occasionally, but he convinces his fans that pilots work hard and play hard, and the casual stories of both his professional lives make interesting listening.

He is also a respected photographer, both of African wildlife ( End of the Game , LJ 2/15/89) and beautiful models (he is the ex-husband of Cheryl Tiegs). Bowermaster describes Beard's experiences during 30 years in Africa, including times spent as a paid hunter, artist, Karen Blixen fan, eccentric, landowner, playboy, brief prison inmate, and, most recently, father. Though schooled in art, Beard would also like to be known as a person who understands wildlife management. Opposing the strict preservationists, he supports the "cull the herd" viewpoint, but he is also convinced that the real problem is human population growth and the resulting inevitable wildlife/human competition for resources. The photos were not seen, but given beard's reputation, they should be impressive. An interesting addition to biography or Africa collections.<br><i>- Nancy Moeckel, Miami Univ.

It examines the lives and careers of more than fifty signal African-American artists, and the relation of their work to prevailing artistic, social, and political trends both in America and throughout the world.<br><br>Beginning with a radical reevaluation of the enigma of Joshua Johnston, a late eighteenth-century portrait painter widely assumed by historians to be one of the earliest known African-American artists, Bearden and Henderson go on to examine the careers of Robert S. Duncanson, Edward M. Bannister, Henry Ossawa Tanner, Aaron Douglas, Edmonia Lewis, Jacob Lawrence, Hale A. Woodruff, Augusta Savage, Charles H. Alston, Ellis Wilson, Archibald J. Motley, Jr., Horace Pippin, Alma W. Thomas, and many others.<br><br>Illustrated with more than 420 black-and-white illustrations and 61 color reproductions -- including rediscovered classics, works no longer extant, and art never before seen in this country -- A History of African-American Artists is a stunning achievement.</p><p>Romare Bearden's works have been exhibited throughout the world, and are in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Hirshhorn Gallery, and the Whitney Museum. Among the many honors he received was the National Medal of Arts, in 1987. Bearden died in 1988, at the age of seventy-six.<br><br>Harry Henderson has written for Collier's, Cosmopolitan, Harper's, Reader's Digest, and Redbook, among other magazines and journals. He previously collaborated with Romare Bearden on Six Black Masters of American Art. Henderson lives in Croton-on-the-Hudson, New York.The late Romare Bearden, a premier African American artist in his own right, devoted 15 years to researching and writing this magnificent study of the lives and achievements of 36 significant African American artists born prior to 1925. He and longtime friend and coauthor Henderson were motivated by frustration over the lack of literature on black artists. Through great perseverance and determination, they managed to track down forgotten artwork, piece together vivid biographical portraits, and conduct interviews with surviving artists, who, in spite of their stature and longevity, had never before been interviewed. As Bearden and Henderson set the scene, historically speaking, for such artists as Robert S. Duncanson, Edmonia Lewis, and Henry Ossawa Tanner, they expose the degree to which racism limited opportunities for black artists. The life stories of the artists associated with the Black Renaissance during the 1920s--such as Aaron Douglas; Archibald Motley, the first painter to boldly celebrate urban African American society; and sculptor and influential mentor Augusta Savage--are recorded with consummate insight, as are accounts of the giants of the Depression era, Beauford Delaney and Jacob Lawrence. Richly illustrated and written with resounding empathy and pride, this is a major contribution to the literature on African American history and to the annals of American art. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>The Star That Astonished the World</h2><p>From the introduction: &#34;This book seeks to identify the Star of Bethlehem mentioned in the New Testament. This is not religious book. It is a book of science and history to demonstrate what was the star that led the Wise Men to Bethlehem. The new evidence that is given will make the story of the Nativity a much more reasonable and interesting account than most historical narratives have provided up to now. ... Since the introduction of computers in the study of astronomical phenomena that occurred within past history, great strides have been made in the past twenty years in determining the actual chronology of those historical events of the past. These facilities were not available to earlier historians and theologians trying to determine what the Star of Bethlehem really was. That is why this new evidence, that comes from up-to-date scientific evaluations, has made it much easier to find the &#34;star&#34; that led the Wise Men to the infant Jesus. The identification of the Bethlehem Star is an event that astronomy can provide. This book gives the historical and biblical evidence (along with the astronomical) that makes the identification possible. There is one thing for certain. The astronomical and historical information given in this book make the period of Jesus&#39; nativity come alive as never before. Whether people today wish to view these planetary/stellar events (that I present in this book) from the early Roman, Mesopotamian or a Palestinian perspective, or even from a modern secular one, we now have clean evidence that there was once (at the very beginning of our era) a unique appearance of a magnificent &#34;Star that Astonished the World.&#34;&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Fixing the Money Thing</h2><p>Let Gary Keesee lead you on an exciting journey of adventure and discovery that ends in a place of financial freedom and peace.

Urrea has researched historical accounts and family records for years to get an accurate story.</p><p>Luis Alberto Urrea is the recipient of an American Book Award, a Western States Book Award, and a Colorado Book Award, and he has been inducted into the Latino Literary Hall of Fame.Starred Review. "Her powers were growing now, like her body. No one knew where the strange things came from. Some said they sprang up in her after the desert sojourn with Huila. Some said they came from somewhere else, some deep inner landscape no one could touch. That they had been there all along." Teresita, the real-life "Saint of Cabora," was born in 1873 to a 14-year-old Indian girl impregnated by a prosperous rancher near the Mexico-Arizona border. Raised in dire poverty by an abusive aunt, the little girl still learned music and horsemanship and even to read: she was a "chosen child," showing such remarkable healing powers that the ranch's medicine woman took her as an apprentice, and the rancher, Don Tom�s Urrea, took her&#x2014;barefoot and dirty&#x2014;into his own household. At 16, Teresita was raped, lapsed into a coma and apparently died. At her wake, though, she sat up in her coffin and declared that it was not for her. Pilgrims came to her by the thousands, even as the Catholic Church denounced her as a heretic; she was also accused of fomenting an Indian uprising against Mexico and, at 19, sentenced to be shot. From this already tumultuous tale of his great-aunt Teresa, American Book Award&#x2013;winner Urrea (<i>The Devil's Highway</i>) fashions an astonishing novel set against the guerrilla violence of post&#x2013;Civil War southwestern border disputes and incipient revolution. His brilliant prose is saturated with the cadences and insights of Latin-American magical realism and tempered by his exacting reporter's eye and extensive historical investigation. The book is wildly romantic, sweeping in its effect, employing the techniques of Catholic hagiography, Western fairy tale, Indian legend and everyday family folklore against the gritty historical realities of war, poverty, prejudice, lawlessness, torture and genocide. Urrea effortlessly links Teresita's supernatural calling to the turmoil of the times, concealing substantial intellectual content behind effervescent storytelling and considerable humor. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Alongside gentle illustrations of a diverse array of children, the text explains not only how poverty and hunger can affect people but the wide array of circumstances, "which are often outside of people's control," than can lead to poverty, such as famine, natural disasters, war, global warming, low-paying jobs, and even systemic poverty. The simplified concepts, straightforward sentences, and illustrations make the tough concepts easy to bear, as does the second half of the book, which focuses on charities that feed the hungry, build hospitals and schools, care for refugees, and offer other assistance to people in need. The resources list includes fiction about children in poverty as well as charitable organizations aimed at helping children make a difference in the fight against poverty and hunger. This is a compassionate, lucid treatment of a sensitive topic that young readers will not only be perfectly equipped to understand, but they'll likely be moved to take action, too."<br>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i></p><h2>Off My Case for Kids: 12 Stories to Help You Defend Your Faith (Case for...

She stepped high over Mandy Witherspoon&#39;s outstretched foot so she wouldn&#39;t trip, but she lost her grip on her books. And the kids&#39; giggles made her face flush like fire. &#39;Come on, let&#39;s go!&#39; The bus driver looked up in the rearview mirror and yelled at her. &#39;And if you&#39;re late again tomorrow morning, you&#39;re going to have to walk.&#39; Lydia held the tears in --- just barely --- scooped up her books, and scrambled off the bus as fast as her legs would take her. &#39;Speak English much?&#39; She didn&#39;t turn to see who had yelled the insult, but she could guess. Mandy Witherspoon. What did that girl have against her? She wished she didn&#39;t hear some of the taunts at school, wished she understood why some of the kids looked at her with so much hatred sometimes. You don&#39;t belong here! Get back over the border where you came from! But we&#39;re not going back. Lydia stood in her muddy front yard for a minute, catching her breath and letting the rain wash the tears from her face. She didn&#39;t really miss what they&#39;d left behind in Mexico. Except back there, everybody else was just as poor as Lydia and her grandmother. Just as poor, and just as desperate to find something better. At least here . . . &#39;At least here what, Lord?&#39; she prayed out loud as she pushed open the front door to their apartment. Her thirteen year- old sister wasn&#39;t home, as usual. And her grandmother would not return home for another two hours, maybe later, depending on what shift they gave her at the burger place. &#39;What do we have now that&#39;s better than back home?&#39; Well, plenty, when she stopped to think about it. She sat down at the wobbly kitchen table and spread out her soggy books. Books, for one thing. A school to go to, and not all the kids were as mean as Mandy Witherspoon. A tiny apartment with a bathroom and a telephone. Three small rooms, which was not much compared to what a lot of other Americans had. But compared to what they had back in Mexico? She would not soon forget the tar-paper shack they used to live in, her and a dozen other relatives: aunts and uncles and nieces and nephews, and all without a bathroom. She rested her head on her open English textbook for a minute, telling the Lord she was sorry for the way she complained. He had brought them here for a reason, she knew. She and Grandmother had prayed about it, looked for the answer. &#39;I&#39;m sorry, God. Help me to know why I&#39;m here, and what you want me to do.&#39; But she was tired of trying to figure it out. Right now she would close her eyes for just a minute . . . Lydia felt a soft hand on her shoulder, shaking her awake. Her grandmother stood over her, still in her fast-food uniform. Lydia didn&#39;t quite follow. She had just laid her head down a minute ago. &#39;What are you doing home so early?&#39; &#39;How long have you been sleeping? It&#39;s almost six-thirty.&#39; Lydia jumped up, nearly knocking over one of the grocery bags now on the table. She must have fallen asleep. &#39;And look at all this!&#39; Her grandmother brought one last bag in from the hallway and set it down with a clunk on the kitchen table. She pointed to at least a dozen bags, now piled all over. Each one was stuffed with good things: canned peaches, a large ham, cranberries . . . &#39;I&#39;ve never tasted these before.&#39; Lydia brought the can closer to see. Unreal. Everything looked so . . . &#39;And look here!&#39; Her grandmother pulled out a large frozen bird. &#39;Not just one turkey . . . two!&#39; Two turkeys! It was easy to dance about the kitchen, giggling at each new discovery, pulling out packages of marshmallows and spaghetti, canned tuna and sweet potatoes. So many strange foods. Did all Americans eat like this? &#39;A feast!&#39; her grandmother cried, but then she stopped and looked Lydia in the eye. &#39;But you didn&#39;t hear?&#39; &#39;I didn&#39;t even hear you come in.&#39; &#39;Then who brought all this? It was all left outside.&#39; Lydia had no clue, except that she&#39;d heard church groups sometimes delivered groceries to needy families during the holidays. And they, it seemed, were one of those needy families. But when she looked at her grandma, they both smiled at the same time. For a moment they felt more like sisters than grandmother and granddaughter, abuela and nieta. &#39;Are you thinking what I&#39;m thinking?&#39; Lydia asked, and her grandmother nodded her head. &#39;I think so. We each take a bag, and come back for more.&#39; &#39;One bag for each house?&#39; That would be fine, so they pulled cans and hams from one bag to the other, spreading out the gifts they would take to others who were less fortunate than they. God had given them this food for a reason, had he not? And this would be part of the answer to their prayers. Lydia couldn&#39;t keep the grin from her face as they hurried out into the cold, driving rain. Now it didn&#39;t matter. &#39;Which house first?&#39; she asked as they hurried down the street. That would not be the hard part. The hard part was getting away from the families who discovered them before they could get away. One older woman started crying and wanted them to come into her tiny apartment. &#39;Thank you, no.&#39; Lydia&#39;s abuela smiled and held her granddaughter&#39;s hand. &#39;We have more to deliver before it gets too late, and we&#39;re far from home. But . . . &#39; She paused, and Lydia filled in what they had already told a handful of other families. How much they loved Jesus, and how he had answered their prayers. Each time she said it to someone new, she felt a little less shy. He had given them so much, even before the groceries; otherwise, she knew, they would not be doing this. And for the first time, Lydia knew it was really true. The old woman looked at them with tears in her eyes. &#39;But we just want you to know . . . ,&#39; Lydia added, and it wasn&#39;t as hard to say now as it was the first time. &#39;We want you to know how much Jesus loves you.&#39; They left the old woman watching them through the window, and Lydia paused for a moment outside an older mobile home, looking something like the Titanic in its last moments. A dog growled from the darkness. &#39;Here?&#39; Lydia wondered, still holding a grocery bag with their one remaining turkey. Her grandmother looked back at her with concern on her face. But Lydia didn&#39;t wait, just pushed open the gate and threaded her way past parts of a junk car as she walked up to the door. The dog went wild behind the door when she knocked.</p><h2>The Knitting Diaries: The Twenty-First WishComing UnraveledReturn to Summer Island (A Blossom Street Novel)</h2><p><br><br><em>The Twenty-First Wish</em> by Debbie Macomber<br><br>Anne Marie Roche and her adopted daughter, ten-year-old Ellen, have each written a list of twenty wishes&#x2014;on which they included <em>learning to knit.</em> But Ellen has quietly added a <em>twenty-first</em> wish: that her mom will fall in love with Tim, Ellen's birth father, who's recently entered their lives....<br><br><em>Coming Unraveled</em> by Susan Mallery<br><br>When Robyn Mulligan's dreams of becoming a Broadway star give way to longing for her childhood home, she returns to Texas, running her grandmother's knitting store.

Usually, I'm organized and in control, but today I'm not (even if I look as though I am). On the inside&#x2014;and I don't mind admitting this&#x2014;I'm a mess.<br><br>Mostly, I'm worried about Ellen. My ten-year-old has already had so much upheaval in her life. She feels secure in our tiny apartment. And it <em>is </em>tiny. It was just right for one small dog and me, but I never intended to stay here so long. When I moved into this space above the bookstore it was with the hope&#x2014;the expectation&#x2014;that Robert and I would reconcile. But the unthinkable happened and I lost my husband to a heart attack. After his funeral I remained here because making it from one day to the next was all I could deal with.<br><br>Then Ellen came into my life and it was obvious that two people and a dog, no matter how small, couldn't live comfortably in this minuscule space, although we managed for more than a year. I did make an earlier offer on a house but that didn't work out.<br><br>After bouncing from foster home to foster home, Ellen had ended up with her grandmother, who died when she was eight. So Ellen needed stability. She'd endured enough without having a move forced upon her so soon after the adoption.<br><br>In retrospect, I'm grateful that first house deal fell through, since it would've happened too fast for Ellen&#x2014;although I was disappointed at the time. Even now, Ellen feels uneasy about leaving Blossom Street, although I've reassured her that we aren't <em>really </em>leaving. Blossom Street Books is still here and so is the apartment. The only thing that'll be different is that at the end of the workday, instead of walking up the stairs, we'll drive home.<br><br>Sitting in the office of the Seattle title company, Anne Marie Roche signed her name at the bottom of the last document. She leaned back and felt the tension ease from between her shoulder blades. As of this moment she was the proud owner of her own home. Today was the culmination of several months of effort. She smiled at the two sellers who sat across the table from her; they looked equally happy.<br><br>"Is the house ours now?" Ellen whispered as she tugged at the sleeve of Anne Marie's jacket. "It is," she whispered back.<br><br>A few years ago Anne Marie had merely been going through the motions. Robert, her husband, had died, and she'd found herself a widow at the age of forty. She had no one in her life who loved her, no one she could love. All right, she had friends and family and she had her dog, Baxter, a Yorkie&#x2014;admittedly a special dog&#x2014;but Anne Marie needed <em>more, </em>wanted more. She'd craved the intense, focused, mutual love of a spouse, or a child of her own. Then she'd met Ellen through a volunteer program and they'd grown close. When Ellen's grandmother, Dolores, who'd been raising the girl, became seriously ill, Anne Marie had stepped in&#x2014;at Dolores's urging. She'd taken over as the girl's foster mother and, after Dolores's death, adopted her. Dolores must have known she was reaching the end of her life, and when she saw how attached Ellen and Anne Marie were, she'd been able to die in peace, confident in the knowledge that her granddaughter would be safe and, above all, loved.<br><br>"You can cross finding a house off your list of twenty wishes," Ellen said, referring to the list Anne Marie had compiled with a group of widowed friends the year she'd met Ellen.<br><br>The child's straight brown hair brushed her shoulders, with a tiny red bow clipped at each temple. Her eyes were wide with expectation&#x2014;and a little fear. Anne Marie hoped Ellen would quickly adjust to her new home and neighborhood, although Ellen kept insisting she liked her old one just fine.<br><br>"We want you to be as happy in this home as we've been," Mr. Johnson, the previous owner, said. With a great deal of ceremony he and his wife handed the house key to Anne Marie. The Johnsons, an older couple who'd lived there for more than twenty years, planned to move to Arizona to spend their retirement near friends.<br><br>"I'm sure we will," Anne Marie said. She'd looked at a number of places and this was the first one that felt right, with its large backyard and spacious rooms. Ellen would be able to go to the school she currently attended, which Anne Marie considered a bonus.<br><br>She would do whatever she could to ensure that the transition would be a smooth one for her daughter. Ellen had made friends on Blossom Street, people she visited almost every day, and she could continue doing that. Her favorite stop was A Good Yarn, Lydia Goetz's store. Both Anne Marie and Ellen had learned to knit, thanks to Lydia.<br><br>"You <em>promise </em>I'll like the new house as much as Blossom Street?" Ellen asked with a skeptical frown.<br><br>"You're going to love having a big bedroom."<br><br>"I like my old bedroom," she said, lowering her head.<br><br>"Yes, but you'll like this one just as much." This was a conversation they'd had a number of times already. "And Baxter's going to enjoy racing around that big backyard, chasing butterflies."<br><br>The hint of a smile touched Ellen's face, and Anne Marie put her arm around the girl's shoulders. "Everything's going to be fine," she said. "You'll see."<br><br>Ellen nodded uncertainly.<br><br>Now that the paperwork had been completed, Anne Marie thanked the title agent, who'd been so helpful.<br><br>With the house keys safely inside her purse, she stood and reached for Ellen's hand. "Mel's taking us out for a celebratory lunch," she said on their way out the door.<br><br>"What's <em>celebratory </em>mean?"<br><br>"It means we have something to celebrate, and that's our brand-new home." New to them at any rate. She raised her voice to show how pleased she was that this day had finally arrived.<br><br>"What about Dad?"<br><br>"We'll see him later." Over the past few months, Anne Marie's relationship with Tim Carlsen had become...complicated. He was Ellen's biological father and hadn't known he had a daughter until after Anne Marie had adopted her. Tim had connected with Ellen through a long and indirect process. Anne Marie had reluctantly&#x2014;very reluctantly&#x2014;granted him permission to visit Ellen. Thankfully, Tim, who'd acknowledged his problems with drug and alcohol abuse, was now clean and sober. He'd turned his life around several years before, unlike Ellen's biological mother, who was still incarcerated. She'd surrendered her parental rights, which had made it possible for Anne Marie to adopt the child. It was only after Anne Marie saw how much Tim loved his daughter that she'd softened toward him. All too soon, a rosy, and completely unrealistic, picture had formed in her mind&#x2014;the three of them together, as one happy family.<br><br>Then Tim had dropped his bombshell and that dream had been blown to smithereens. He was engaged to Vanessa, a woman he'd met at his AA meetings. Anne Marie had felt incredibly foolish even entertaining the notion of the two of them as a couple.<br><br>Shortly afterward she'd met Mel through her friend Barbie. He was a widower, the same age Robert would have been&#x2014;close to twenty years older than Anne Marie. Mel was a comfortable person, easy to be with, unthreat-ening and undemanding. He got along well with Ellen, too. They'd been dating for a few months, and while it wasn't a steamy romance or an exciting one, she was content.<br><br>Mel's attention had helped soothe her ego after the letdown she'd experienced with Tim. The ironic part was that shortly after she'd started seeing Mel, Tim and Vanessa had parted ways. After her disappointment with Tim, Anne Marie wasn't willing to make her heart vulnerable to him again. She'd made that clear and he'd accepted her decision. She let him see Ellen, however. Her daughter loved being part of her father's life and looked forward to spending time with him.<br><br>"Where's Mel taking us to celebrate?" Ellen asked as they rode the elevator down to the ground floor. There was a light drizzle outside, not unusual for April in Seattle. It wasn't heavy enough to warrant an umbrella, but damp enough to curl Anne Marie's naturally wavy hair.<br><br>"We're meeting him in Chinatown," Anne Marie answered.<br><br>"We're having Chinese?"<br><br>This was Ellen's all-time-favorite food. "Can I order chow mein with crispy noodles?" she asked.<br><br>"I'm sure you can." How thoughtful of Mel to remember Ellen's preference for Chinese cuisine. He really was a good man; she doubted there was anything he wouldn't do for her if she asked.<br><br>"What about almond fried chicken with extra gravy?"<br><br>"You'll need to discuss that with Mel." Once out on the sidewalk, Anne Marie took Ellen's hand again, and with their heads bowed against the cold and the wind, they hurried toward the restaurant.<br><br>Mel was already there and had obtained a booth. A large pot of tea with three small ceramic cups rested in the center of the table. Anne Marie was grateful Mel had thought to order it.<br><br>He stood as they approached and leaned forward to kiss Anne Marie's cheek.<br><br>"Hello, Pumpkin," he said to Ellen.<br><br>"Hi, Punky," she returned with a giggle. Where Ellen had come up with that name for Mel, Anne Marie had no idea. Maybe her version of "pumpkin"? In any event, Anne Marie appreciated their relaxed, friendly relationship.<br><br>When the waitress arrived, they ordered far more food than they'd ever manage to eat.<br><br>While they waited for their lunch, Mel made conversation with Ellen. "This is perfect weather for Baxter to wear that sweater you knit him," he said.<br><br>Ellen had made her own list of twenty wishes, and learning to knit was one of them. Fortunately, Lydia's yarn shop was only a couple of doors down from the bookstore, and Lydia had encouraged Ellen's first efforts. With practice, Ellen had improved to the point that she was able to complete a sweater for Baxter.<br><br>"After lunch, would you like to show Mel the house?" Anne Marie prompted. She wanted Ellen to feel good about this move. Ellen had gone with Anne Marie to view various houses and had found something wrong with each one. It finally dawned on Anne Marie that Ellen simply didn't want to leave Blossom Street, which she should've realized from the start. The little girl wouldn't say so directly but she came up with convenient excuses to reject every home they'd seen&#x2014;until this one. If Anne Marie had been more experienced as a parent she might have caught on earlier. But Ellen's resistance was the main reason she'd put off the search after the first deal fell through.<br><br>"Do you want to see the house?" Ellen asked Mel, sounding hesitant.<br><br>"I'd enjoy that, especially if you'd give me a personal tour."<br><br>Ellen glanced at Anne Marie. "Mel would like you to show him around," Anne Marie explained.<br><br>"I can do that," Ellen said, revealing her first enthusiasm for their new home. "I know every room. Did Mom tell you I have a big closet of my own and my bedroom faces the backyard, so I can look out my window and watch Baxter? He likes to chase birds and butterflies and bugs. I won't have to take him for walks anymore because there's a fence.... I can just open the door and let him go out."<br><br>"True, but it's still a good idea to keep an eye on him," Anne Marie reminded her. <em>"And </em>to take him for walks."<br><br>Ellen nodded.<br><br>"I'll bet there are lots of kids your age in the new neighborhood," Mel said.<br><br>Anne Marie hoped that was the case, although she hadn't seen any.<br><br>Ellen toyed with her fork and plate, moving the fork around the plate's circumference. "I like my old neighborhood best," she muttered.<br><br>"But it's a retail one," Mel said.<br><br>Ellen looked quizzically at Anne Marie. "He means there are shops on Blossom Street instead of houses."<br><br>"I <em>like </em>shops. I have friends there. Susannah lets me help her with the flowers in Susannah's Garden. Last week I stood out front of her store and gave away pink carnations. Baxter was with me."<br><br>"That was fun, wasn't it?"<br><br>Ellen nodded again. "And Alix sometimes brings me leftover croissants from the French Caf� across the street."<br><br>Laughing, Anne Marie brought her head close to Mel's and added, "That doesn't happen often because they sell out of croissants almost every day."<br><br>"I like them warm so the jelly gets runny on them," Ellen said. "Mom puts them in the microwave for me in the morning."<br><br>"I'll have to try that," Mel told her. "Sounds good."<br><br>"Lydia and Margaret are my friends, too." Ellen continued to list her favorite people on Blossom Street.<br><br>"Lydia owns A Good Yarn," Anne Marie pointed out to Mel.<br><br>"Yeah, I remember," he said.<br><br>"Lydia and Mom taught me to knit, and we knit every day, don't we, Mom?"<br><br>Before Anne Marie could respond, their food arrived. The conversation lagged as they passed around the serving plates. Mel asked for chopsticks, but Anne Marie and Ellen used forks&#x2014;although Ellen proclaimed that she wanted to try chopsticks <em>next </em>time. She was just too hungry today.<br><br>"You have lots of friends, don't you?" Mel asked<br><br>Ellen.<br><br>Mouth full, the girl nodded eagerly.<br><br>"But they're all adults. Do you have any friends from school on Blossom Street?"<br><br>After a short pause, Ellen said, "Cody and Casey, but they're older and they go to a different school than me."<br><br>Anne Marie could see that Mel was trying to help Ellen see all the possibilities that awaited her in her new home. She thanked him with a smile, and he clasped her hand beneath the table.<br><br>Half an hour later, when they couldn't eat another bite, Mel asked for the bill. Carrying their leftovers, Anne Marie and Ellen walked to the parking garage for their car. Mel drove to the house on his own.<br><br>Anne Marie and Ellen got there before him and after parking in the driveway, Anne Marie unlocked the front door, conscious that this was the first of many times. The inside looked different now that it was empty of furniture. The Johnsons had left the house meticulously clean, the floors scrubbed and polished and the walls freshly painted and unmarked.<br><br>Mel showed up soon afterward. "What a lovely house," he commented, stepping inside. He paused in the doorway to survey the hall and the living room.<br><br>"Come," Ellen said, grabbing his hand and tugging him toward the hallway. "My bedroom's this way."<br><br>"What about your mom's?" he asked, looking back at Anne Marie over his shoulder.<br><br>She nearly burst out laughing.<br><br>"Mom's across the hall from me," Ellen told him.<br><br></p><h2>Fire of Love for Students of Life for Teachers of Yoga</h2><p>&#x201c;Yoga is not to be performed; yoga is to be lived.&#x201d; The purpose of this book is to reveal and restore the lost essence of yoga, to infuse contemporary yoga with its ancient and future message, the message of the heart.

But does his new cowgirl? He has his doubts that Morie Brannt will be able to pull her own weight, even if the petite young woman does seem to have a lot of spirit.<br><br>As they spar over events at the ranch and a past that threatens their hopes for the future, sparks begin to fly, and Mallory can't help but notice Morie in a new light. But is this tough Wyoming man ready to love?<br><br></p><p>The prolific author of more than one hundred books, Diana Palmer got her start as a newspaper reporter. A New York Times bestselling author and voted one of the top ten romance writers in America, she has a gift for telling the most sensual tales with charm and humor. Diana lives with her family in Cornelia, Georgia.<br><br>Edith Danielle Morena Brannt was not impressed with her new boss. The head honcho of the Rancho Real, or Royal Ranch in Spanish, near Catelow, Wyoming, was big and domineering and had a formidable bad attitude that he shared with all his hired hands.<br><br>Morie, as she was known to her friends, had a hard time holding back her fiery temper when Mallory Dawson Kirk raised his voice. He was impatient and hot-tempered and opinionated. Just like Morie's father, who'd opposed her decision to become a working cowgirl. Her dad opposed everything. She'd just told him she was going to find a job, packed her bags and left. She was twenty-three. He couldn't really stop her legally. Her mother, Shelby, had tried gentle reason. Her brother, Cort, had tried, too, with even less luck. She loved her family, but she was tired of being chased for who she was related to instead of who she was inside. Being a stranger on somebody else's property was an enchanting proposition.<br><br>Even with Mallory's temper, she was happy being accepted for a poor, struggling female on her own in the harsh world. Besides that, she wanted to learn ranch work and her father refused to let her so much as lift a rope on his ranch. He didn't want her near his cattle.<br><br>"And another thing," Mallory said harshly, turning to Morie with a cold glare, "there's a place to hang keys when you're through with them. You never take a key out of the stable and leave it in your pocket. Is that clear?''<br><br>Morie, who'd actually transported the key to the main tack room off the property in her pocket at a time it was desperately needed, flushed. "Sorry, sir," she said stiffly. "Won't happen again."<br><br>"It won't if you expect to keep working here," he assured her.<br><br>"My fault," the foreman, old Darby Hanes, chimed in, smiling. "i forgot to tell her."<br><br>Mallory considered that and nodded finally. "That's what I always liked most about you, Darb, you're honest." He turned to Morie. "An example I'll expect you to follow, as our newest hire, by the way."<br><br>Her face reddened. "Sir, I've never taken anything that didn't belong to me."<br><br>He looked at her cheap clothes, the ragged hem of her jeans, her worn boots. But he didn't judge. He just nodded.<br><br>He had thick black hair, parted on one side and a little shaggy around the ears. He had big ears and a big nose, deep-set brown eyes under a jutting brow, thick eyebrows and a mouth so sensuous that Morie hadn't been able to take her eyes off it at first. That mouth made up for his lack of conventional good looks. He had big, well-manicured hands and a voice like deep velvet, as well as big feet, in old, rugged, dirt-caked boots. He was the boss, and nobody ever forgot it, but he got down in the mud and blood with his men and worked as if he was just an employee himself.<br><br>In fact, all three Kirk brothers were like that. Mallory was the oldest, at thirty-six. The second brother, Cane&#x2014;a coincidence if there ever was one, considering Morie's mother's maiden name, even if hers was spelled with a <em>K</em>&#x2014;was thirty-four, a veteran of the Second Gulf War, and he was missing an arm from being in the front lines in combat. He was confronting a drinking problem and undergoing therapy, which his brothers were trying to address.<br><br>The youngest brother, at thirty-one, was Dalton. He was a former border agent with the department of immigration, and his nickname was, for some odd reason, Tank. He'd been confronted by a gang of narco-smugglers on the Arizona border, all alone. He was shot to pieces and hospitalized for weeks, during which most of the physicians had given him up for dead because of the extent of his injuries. He confounded them all by living. Nevertheless, he quit the job and came home to the family ranch in Wyoming. He never spoke of the experience. But once Morie had seen him react to the backfire of an old ranch truck by diving to the ground. She'd laughed, but old Darby Hanes had silenced her and told her about Dalton's past as a border agent. She'd never laughed at his odd behaviors again. She supposed that both he and Cane had mental and emotional scars, as well as physical ones, from their past experiences. She'd never been shot at, or had anything happen to her. She'd been as sheltered as a hothouse orchid, both by her parents and her brother. This was her first taste of real life. She wasn't certain yet if she was going to like it.<br><br>She'd lived on her father's enormous ranch all her life. She could ride anything&#x2014;her father had taught her himself. But she wasn't accustomed to the backbreaking work that daily ranch chores required, because she hadn't been permitted to do them at home, and she'd been slow her first couple of days.<br><br>Darby Hanes had taken her in hand and shown her how to manage the big bales of hay that the brothers still packed into the barn&#x2014;refusing the more modern rolled bales as being inefficient and wasteful&#x2014;so that she didn't hurt herself when she lifted them. He'd taught her how to shoe horses, even though the ranch had a farrier, and how to doctor sick calves. In less than two weeks, she'd learned things that nothing in her college education had addressed.<br><br>"You've never done this work before," Darby accused, but he was smiling.<br><br>She grimaced. "No. But I needed a job, badly," she said, and it was almost the truth. "You've been great, Mr. Hanes. I owe you a lot for not giving me away. For teaching me what I needed to know here." And what a good thing it was, she thought privately, that her father didn't know. He'd have skinned Hanes alive for letting his sheltered little girl shoe a horse.<br><br>He waved a hand dismissively. "Not a problem. You make sure you wear those gloves," he added, nodding toward her back pocket. "You have beautiful hands. Like my wife used to," he added with a faraway look in his eyes and a faint smile. "She played the piano in a restaurant when I met her. We went on two dates and got married. Never had kids. She passed two years ago, from cancer." He stopped for a minute and took a long breath. "Still miss her," he added stiffly.<br><br>"I'm sorry," she said.<br><br>"I'll see her again," he replied. "Won't be too many years, either. It's part of the cycle, you see. Life and death. We all go through it. Nobody escapes."<br><br>That was true. How odd to be in a philosophical discussion on a ranch.<br><br>He lifted an eyebrow. "You think ranch hands are high-school dropouts, do you?" he mused. "I have a degree from MIT. I was their most promising student in theoretical physics, but my wife had a lung condition and they wanted her to come west to a drier climate. Her dad had a ranch..." He stopped, chuckling. "Sorry. I tend to run on. Anyway, I worked on the ranch and preferred it to a lab. After she died, I came here to work. So here I am. But I'm not the only degreed geek around here. We have three part-timers who are going to college on scholarships the Kirk brothers set up for them."<br><br>"What a nice bunch of guys!" she exclaimed.<br><br>"They really are. All of them seem tough as nails, and they mostly are, but they'll help anyone in need." He shifted. "Paid my wife's hospital bill after the insurance lapsed. A small fortune, and they didn't even blink."<br><br>Her throat got tight. What a generous thing to do. Her family had done the same for people, but she didn't dare mention that. "That was good of them," she said with genuine feeling.<br><br>"Yes. I'll work here until I die, if they'll keep me. They're great people."<br><br>They heard a noise and turned around. The boss was standing behind them.<br><br>"Thanks for the testimonial, but I believe there are cattle waiting to be dipped in the south pasture...." Mallory commented with pursed lips and twinkling dark eyes.<br><br>Darby chuckled. "Yes, there are. Sorry, boss, I was just lauding you to the young lady. She was surprised to find out that I studied philosophy."<br><br>"Not to mention theoretical physics," the boss added drily.<br><br>"Yes, well, I won't mention your degree in biochemistry if you like," Darby said outrageously.<br><br>Mallory quirked an eyebrow. "Thanks."<br><br>Darby winked at Morie and left them alone.<br><br>Mallory towered over the slight brunette. "Your name is unusual. Morie...?"<br><br>She laughed. "My full name is Edith Danielle Morena Brannt," she replied. "My mother knew I'd be a brunette, because both my parents are, so they added <em>morena,</em> which means <em>brunette</em> in Spanish. I had, uh, Spanish great-grandparents," she stuttered, having almost given away the fact that they were titled Spanish royalty. That would never do. She wanted to be perceived as a poor, but honest, cowgirl. Her last name wasn't uncommon in South Texas, and Mallory wasn't likely to connect it with King Brannt, who was a true cattle baron.<br><br>He cocked his head. "Morie," he said. "Nice."<br><br>"I'm really sorry, about the key," she said.<br><br>He shrugged. "I did the same thing last month, but I'm the boss," he added firmly. "I don't make mistakes. You remember that."<br><br>She gave him an open smile. "Yes, sir."<br><br>He studied her curiously. She was small and nicely rounded, with black hair that was obviously long and pulled into a bun atop her head. She wasn't beautiful, but she was pleasant to look at, with those big brown eyes and that pretty mouth and perfect skin. She didn't seem the sort to do physical labor on a ranch.<br><br>"Sir?" she asked, uncomfortable from the scrutiny.<br><br>"Sorry. I was just thinking that you don't look like the usual sort we hire for ranch hands."<br><br>"I do have a college degree," she defended herself.<br><br>"You do? What was your major?"<br><br>"History," she said, and looked defensive. "Yes, it's dates. Yes, it's about the past. Yes, some of it can be boring. But I love it."<br><br>He looked at her thoughtfully. "You should talk to Cane. His degree is in anthropology. Pity it wasn't paleontology, because we're close to Fossil Lake. That's part of the Green River Formation, and there are all sorts of fossils there. Cane loved to dig." His face hardened. "He won't talk about going back to it."<br><br>"Because of his arm?" she asked bluntly. "That wouldn't stop him. He could do administrative work on a dig." She flushed. "I minored in anthropology," she confessed.<br><br>He burst out laughing. "No wonder you like ranch work. Did you go on digs?" He knew, as some people didn't, that archaeology was one of four subfields of anthropology.<br><br>"I did. Drove my mother mad. My clothes were always full of mud and I looked like a street child most of the time." She didn't dare tell him that she'd come to dinner in her dig clothing when a famous visiting politician from Europe was at the table, along with some members of a royal family. Her father had been eloquent. "There were some incidents when I came home muddy," she added with a chuckle.<br><br>"I can imagine." He sighed. "Cane hasn't adjusted to the physical changes. He's stopped going to therapy and he won't join in any family outings. He stays in his room playing online video games." He stopped. "Good Lord, I can't believe I'm telling you these things."<br><br>"I'm as quiet as a clam," she pointed out. "I never tell anything I know."<br><br>"You're a good listener. Most people aren't."<br><br>She smiled.

Nigel Pennick discloses the key to all structure - from molecules to the human body to galaxies - as he traces the history of this transcendent form megalithic stone circles through Gothic cathedrals and Baroque churches to Art Noveau. Sacred Geometry investigates the best examples of this science: structures that not only exhibit ingenuity and complexity but that were also imbued with magic powers and profound psychological meaning. It shows how each time a geometrical form is created, an expression of universal oneness is made; from the dawn of time religious structures have expressed this unity in every detail. Sacred Geometry discusses the major styles as Egyptian, Classical, Romanesque, Islamic, Gothic, and Renaissance. Enlightening, lucid, and thorough, this insightful book reveals how buildings that conform to these timeless principles mirror the geometry of the cosmos; it also shows us how to live more fully in harmony with the world and ourselves.</p><p></p><h2>A Gentle Giving</h2><p>Willa Hammer has nothing left after narrowly escaping the lynch mob that unjustly hanged her foster father except her dog, her faith, and the protection of a secretive family. She joins their wagon train heading West, never realizing she is traveling to the wilds of Bighorn Mountain, where a rundown ranch and the arms of an untamed, hardened cowboy await her.</p><p>National bestselling and award-winning author of thirty-five romances that often feature the exciting backdrop of the Old West, Dorothy Garlock is one of America&#39;s-and the world&#39;s-favorite novelists. Her books, all enthusiastically reviewed, now total more than eight million copies in print with translations in 15 languages. She lives in Clear Lake, IowaWhen Willa Hammer's guardian is lynched and her home burned, she finds herself heading west with teenage Charlie and Jo Bell Frank, whose down-and-out father has been killed for cheating at cards. The three are heading for the ranch of Oliver Westwood, Charlie and Jo Bell's uncle. They don't know that Oliver has died until they meet up with Smith Bowman, a former protege of Oliver's who predicts that Maud, Oliver's mean-spirited widow, won't let the young people cross her threshold. Arriving at the ranch, Willa finds Maud sprawled on the kitchen floor with a broken leg. They settle in: Charlie to become a cowboy, Jo Bell (who is beautiful, ill-tempered and foul-mouthed) to be a nuisance until she finally runs off with a man, and Willa to perform endless chores and fall in love with Smith. Smith meanwhile tortures himself and the reader with feelings of guilt over Oliver's death. Not even this frontier romance's flood of crude language can obscure the fact that Garlock's ( Glorious Dawn ) boring characters are trapped in a paper-thin plot. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Water From A Bucket: A Diary 1948-1957</h2><p>&#34;Like Tosca, Charles Henri Ford has lived for art and love...a masterpiece&#34;---Edmund White</p><p>Influential American surrealist, writer, and editor, Charles Henri Ford was born in Hazlehurst, Mississippi, in 1913, and growing up lived in Memphis and elsewhere in Tennessee, along with his mother and sister, Ruth, who went on to become a renowned film actress. In 1933 he published &#34;The Young and the Evil,&#34; a novel he wrote with Parker Tyler that was banned in England and America for its subversive content. He is better known, however, for his collections of surrealist magazines &#34;Blues&#34;--which he published from 1929 through 1930 while he was a teenager--and &#34;View&#34;--which ran from 1940 through 1947 and featured seminal works by up-and-coming artists of the time like Joseph cornell, Allen Ginsberg, and Randall Jarrell. Ford&#39;s later collections of verse include &#34;Spare Parts,&#34; (1966) &#34;Om Krishna,&#34; (1978) and &#34;Secret Haiku,&#34; (1982). Charles Henri Ford wrote: &#34;To start off being a poet today you have to be young and full of illusions. To end up being a poet you have to have Another Job.&#34;Ford is a furtive treasure of the American avant-garde. This artist's artist and poet's poet has had a remarkably energetic, fecund and varied existence. By turns bizarre and sweetly domestic, this fractured, infinitely interesting diary begins with his father's illness and ends with the death of his lover Pavel Tchelitchev, the Russian painter with whom he lived for 23 years. Ranging from New York to Geneva to Paris, the diary presents an array of artists and their affiliates, from the Sitwells to Peggy Guggenheim (who had on her wall a "mess signed Jackson Pollock) and Djuna Barnes (with whom Ford had lived while she wrote Nightwood). Born in 1908, Ford made his first literary foray in the 1920s from his Mississippi home with Blues: A Magazine of New Rhythms, with work by Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, Erskine Caldwell and Paul Bowles. When he moved to New York, he collaborated with film critic Parker Tyler on what has been called the first gay novel, The Young and Evil, published in 1933 and banned in the U.S. and England. At 21 he joined Paris's expatriate community. His poetry books include The Garden of Disorder, introduced by William Carlos Williams, and Sleep in a Nest of Flowers, with a foreword by Edith Sitwell. He launched View magazine in 1940, publishing Marcel Duchamp and the first translations of Andr, Breton's poems. This diary offers richly observed details, both quotidian and unusual, constituting a delightful, moving, poetic portrait of a man and a subculture. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Temptation of St. Antony (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Hallucinations and spectral visitations by people and gods from the past cause Saint Anthony to consider a number of metaphysical questions</p><p>A book that deeply influenced the young Freud and was the inspiration for many artists, The Temptation of Saint Anthony was Flaubert's lifelong work, thirty years in the making.

Full color.</p><p>Lydia Marie Child (1802-1880) was a celebrated American author, abolitionist, and women&#39;s rights activist. Born in Medford, MA, her grandfather&#39;s house still stands near the Mystic River as a tangible reminder of her most memorable poem.PreS - Grade 2-- This attractive new presentation of Child's 1844 poem,"A Boy's Thanksgiving Day," offers 13 full-page watercolors done in a detailed and delicately primitive style. As befits this style, the figures are somewhat stiff, and the overall effect is static. The colors are pleasingly light and clear. The childlike illustrations are in keeping with the unsophisticated nature of the rhyming text. Unlike the version illustrated with lively energy by Brinton Turkle (Coward, 1974), only 6 of the 12 verses are included, a streamlining that modern preschool and primary-grade teachers may well appreciate. The text is placed unobtrusively in the sky or on the snow-covered ground, and probably sings better than it reads. A piano arrangement of the familiar melody, a traditional French folk tune, is placed after the text. Child's time-honored poem successfully evokes the happy mood of a traditional and idealized family holiday gathering. --Cynthia Bishop, Onondaga County Public Library, Syracuse, NY<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>TEACHER&#39;S PET #2 (Sweet Valley Twins)</h2><p>Problems erupt between the twins when Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield compete to perform a solo at the upcoming ballet recital, and Jessica becomes jealous of their teacher&#39;s favoritism toward her sister</p><p>Playing favorites ...<p></p><p>Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield are the best dancers in their ballet class.

The focus of the book is to open the "Core" to a new awareness of how body, emotions, mind, will and spirit form a unit. <p>A scholarly text, the author explains in full psychological detail his theory and therapy. The result is a masterpiece of body/mind holistic thinking.</p></p><p>John C. Pierrakos MD is a psychiatrist, body-therapist and an authority on consciousness and human energy fields. He began is work as a student and colleague of Wilhelm Reich, then as a co-founder of Bioenergetics and finally as the founder of the Institute of Core Energetics in New York City. He still maintains a private practice, lectures and teaches all over the world. He is the author of Core Energetics and Eros, Love &amp; Sexuality.The human being possess an unlimited capacity for expansion of consciousness, which is the main characteristic of being human. The real and natural condition of life is joy and fulfillment. To the degree that we fail to reach fulfillment, we have to understand that we have blocked the flow of positive energy and consciousness, which is the essence of the core. In effect, the core both expresses and is the spirituality of human beings. Each person has the ability to mobilize this powerful creative force by becoming aware of the psychological and emotional forces that create blocks which inhibit the life movement. As we increase our awareness of these inner forces, we also increase our capacity to understand life and to be in control of our inner forces.</p><h2>One Big Table: One Big Table</h2><p>From noted food writer Molly O&#x2019;Neill comes a lavish portrait of our nation&#x2019;s contemporary culinary tradition with the best recipes from the greatest home cooks.<br><br>Ten years ago, former <i>New York Times </i>food columnist Molly O&#x2019;Neill embarked on a transcontinental road trip to investigate reports that Americans had stopped cooking at home. As she traveled highways, dirt roads, bayous, and coastlines gathering stories and recipes, it was immediately apparent that dire predictions about the end of American cuisine were vastly overstated. From Park Avenue to trailer parks, from tidy suburbs to isolated outposts, home cooks were channeling their family histories as well as their tastes and personal ambitions into delicious meals. One decade and over 300,000 miles later, <i>One Big Table </i>is a celebration of these cooks, a mouthwatering portrait of the nation at the table.<br> <br>Meticulously selected from more than 20,000 contributions, the cookbook&#x2019;s 600 recipes are a definitive portrait of what we eat and why. In this lavish volume&#x2014;illustrated throughout with historic photographs, folk art, vintage advertisements, and family snapshots&#x2014;O&#x2019;Neill celebrates heirloom recipes like the Doughty family&#x2019;s old-fashioned black duck and dumplings that originated on a long-vanished island off Virginia&#x2019;s Eastern Shore, the Pueblo tamales that Norma Naranjo makes in her horno in New Mexico, as well as modern riffs such as a Boston teenager&#x2019;s recipe for asparagus soup scented with nigella seeds and truffle oil. Many recipes offer a bridge between first-generation immigrants and their progeny&#x2014;the bucatini with dandelion greens and spring garlic that an Italian immigrant and his grandson forage for in the Vermont woods&#x2014;while others are contemporary variations that embody each generation&#x2019;s restless obsession with distinguishing itself from its predecessors. O&#x2019;Neill cooks with artists, writers, doctors, truck drivers, food bloggers, scallop divers, horse trainers, potluckers, and gourmet club members.<br> <br>In a world where takeout is just a phone call away, <i>One Big Table </i>reminds us of the importance of remaining connected to the food we put on our tables. As this brilliantly edited collection shows on every page, the glories of a home-cooked meal prove how every generation has enriched and expanded our idea of American food. Every recipe in this book is a testament to the way our memories&#x2014;historical, cultural, and personal&#x2014;are bound up in our favorite and best family dishes.<br> <br>As O&#x2019;Neill writes, &#x201c;Most Americans cook from the heart as well as from a distinctly American yearning, something I could feel but couldn&#x2019;t describe until thousands of miles of highway helped me identify it in myself: hometown appetite. This book is a journey through hundreds of &#x2018;hometowns&#x2019; that fuel the American appetite, recipe by recipe, bite by bite.&#x201d;</p><p><p><strong>Molly O'Neill on Christmas Cookies</strong></p> <p>People ask me which all-American dish I got the most recipes for in the decade that I traveled across the United States gathering recipes and food stories for <em>One Big Table: A Portrait of American Cooking</em>. Meatloaf? Fried chicken? Macaroni and cheese? Nope. In fact, if I gathered all the recipes for all other American icons together in a single pile, it wouldn&#x2019;t be half as high as the stack of Christmas cookie recipes that I was given. <br></p> <p>There were, of course, dozens of variations on butter cookies and cookie press cookies, dozens of secrets to the making and baking of perfect ginger bread people, candy canes, trees and wreathes. But the majority of Christmas cookie recipes are simply special cookies, cookies that take time and a certain touch, cookies whose recipe is passed from generation to generation, cookies that express all that we wish we brought to the holiday kitchen--warmth, generosity and enough white picket fence fantasy to stretch from sea-to-shining-sea. <br></p> <p>My mother&#x2019;s French almond cookies are perfect example. There is no reason NOT to make the perfectly crisp almond cookies any time of the year. But my mother who, like many Christmas cookie maniacs, began baking a different batch of cookies the day after Thanksgiving and continued until she ran of storage room in the cold attic, baked these cookies only once a year. They keep well, so were always her first batch. To her six children and 14 grandchildren and great-grandchild, the smells of these confections is as much of the season as Frankincense, pine and myrrh. <br></p> <p>When it comes to cookies, Christmas means "special," and "family" and "eat it while you can!" --<em>Molly O'Neill</em></p> <strong>Featured Recipe: Virginia&#x2019;s French Almond Cookies (Columbus, Ohio) from Molly O'Neill&#x2019;s <em>One Big Table</em></strong> <p>Virginia O&#x2019;Neill began making Christmas cookies the day after Thanksgiving and continued making a batch a day until the twentieth of December. "I&#x2019;d grown up as a single child, raised by a wealthy aunt and uncle who were older and quiet. They had cooks and servants and everything was always perfect. I distinguished myself by preparing dinner on the cook&#x2019;s night off and by baking cookies and pies. I started collecting Christmas cookie recipes in grade school, and even after I married into a different life&#x2014;my husband was a dashing working man and I had six children&#x2014;my aunt and uncle expected me to bake. I used to love doing it. Hundreds of intricate, delicate cookies. It was a way of reconciling where I&#x2019;d come from and what I&#x2019;d become, I guess.

Graham argues that such one-sided depictions do not sufficiently account for either the existence of a border state phenomenon during the civil war or the kind of theologizing that was being propagated from out of the border states against the domestication of religion to sectional politics.</p><p>In A Kingdom Not of This World: Stuart Robinson's Struggle to Distinguish the Sacred from the Secular During the Civil War Preston D. Graham, Jr. presents a case study of a rather sizeable movement among border state Presbyterians, with special attention given to their most celebrated and influential leader, the Dr. Rev. Stuart Robinson of Louisville, Kentucky. Given the significance of Robinson's theologizing relative to the American doctrine of the separation of church and state, several primary resources are included in a reader portion of the appendix.</p></p><p></p><h2>Bike Snob Abroad: Strange Customs, Incredible Fiets, and the Quest for Cycling Paradise</h2><p>In his new book, BikeSnobNYC reaches the final frontier of cycling: riding with the family. As his choice to take to the road with his toddler son in tow is met with bewilderment and disapproval from onlookers and the occasional motorist, he ponders why it&#39;s such a taboo. And what does it really mean to be a bike-friendly country? Seeking answers, he heads from the U.S. to London, Amsterdam, Gothenburg, and San Vito dei Normanni in search of an alternative. With humorous anecdotes and his trademark biting wit and wisdom, BikeSnobNYC takes us on his most personal narrative journey yet, and ultimately shines a light on the growing pains that exist in any culture that asks smartphone-obsessed text-happy pedestrians, the two-wheeled, and the four-wheeled to share the road.</p><p>BikeSnobNYC (a.k.a.

She tells the story of her upbringing, lovingly and wittily describing her parents (so memorably fictionalised by her sister Nancy); she talks candidly about her brother and sisters, and their politics (while not being at all political herself), finally setting the record straight. Throughout the book she writes brilliantly about the country and her deep attachment to it and those who live and work in it. As Duchess of Devonshire, Debo played an active role in restoring and overseeing the day-to-day running of the family houses and gardens, and in developing commercial enterprises at Chatsworth. She tells poignantly of the deaths of three of her children, as well as her husband&#39;s battle with alcohol addiction. Wait For Me is enthralling and a total joy, full of the author&#39;s sympathetic wit (which she is not afraid to use on herself).</p><p>The Dowager Duchess of Devonshire was brought up in Oxfordshire. In 1950 her husband Andrew, the 11th Duke of Devonshire, inherited estates in Yorkshire and Ireland as well as Chatsworth, the family seat in Derbyshire, and Deborah became chatelaine and housekeeper of one of England&#39;s greatest and best-loved houses. Following her husband&#39;s death in 2004, she moved to a village on the Chatsworth estate. She died in 2014.Chapter 1&nbsp;We Are Seven <p>Blank. There is no entry in my mother&#x2019;s engagement book for 31 March 1920, the day I was born. The next few days are also blank. The first entry in April, in large letters, is &#x2018;KITCHEN CHIMNEY SWEPT&#x2019;. My parents&#x2019; dearest wish was for a big family of boys; a sixth girl was not worth recording. &#x2018;Nancy, Pam, Tom, Diana, Bobo, Decca, me&#x2019;, intoned in a peculiar voice, was my answer to anyone who asked where I came in the family.</p><p>The sisters were at home and Tom was at boarding school for this deeply disappointing event, more like a funeral than a birth. Years later Mabel, our parlourmaid, told me, &#x2018;I knew what it was by your father&#x2019;s face.&#x2019; When the telegram arrived Nancy announced to the others, &#x2018;We Are Seven&#x2019;, and wrote to Muv at our London house, 49 Victoria Road, Kensington, where she was lying-in, &#x2018;How disgusting of the poor darling to go and be a girl.&#x2019; Life went on as though nothing had happened and all agreed that no one, except Nanny, looked at me till I was three months old and then were not especially pleased by what they saw.</p><p>Grandfather Redesdale&#x2019;s huge house and estate in Gloucestershire, Batsford Park near Moreton-in-Marsh, was inherited by my father in 1916. It was too expensive to keep up and was sold in 1919. My father looked for somewhere more modest near Swinbrook, a small village where he owned land, fifteen miles from Batsford. There was no house there suitable for a family of six children and a seventh on the way, so he bought Asthall Manor in the neighbouring village. I was born soon after the move and my earliest recollections are of the ancient house and its immediate surroundings. Asthall is a typical Cotswold manor, hard by the church, with a garden that descends to the River Windrush. It was loved by my sisters and Tom, and the seven years spent there were probably the happiest for parents and children, the proceeds of the sale of Batsford giving the family a feeling of security that was never repeated.</p><p>There was, and is, something profoundly satisfying in the scale of Asthall village. It was a perfect entity where every element was in proportion to the rest: the manor, the vicarage, the school and pub; the farmhouses with their conveniently placed cowsheds and barns; the cottages, whose occupants supplied the labour for the centuries-old jobs that still existed when we were children; and the pigsties, chicken runs and gardens that belonged to the cottages. Before cars and commuters, you lived close to where you worked and the shops came to you in horse-drawn vans. This was the calm background of a self-contained agricultural parish, regulated by the seasons, in an exceptionally beautiful part of England.</p><p>My father planted woods to hold game, as well as a short beech avenue leading up to the house, and his dark purple lilacs outside the garden wall are still growing there after nearly a hundred years. The house itself needed much restoration. My mother&#x2019;s flair for decoration and her talent for home-making ensured that the French furniture and pictures from Batsford were shown at their best. My father installed water-powered electric light &#x2013; just the sort of contraption he adored; drawing heavily on his umpteenth cigarette, he would lean over the engineer, itching to do the job better himself. He made sure he had a child-proof door to his study by putting the handle high up out of reach. Sometimes we heard the voice of Galli-Curci singing Farve&#x2019;s favourite aria, coming loudly from the outsize horn of his gramophone &#x2013; a twin of the one in advertisements for His Master&#x2019;s Voice. In another mood he might put on &#x2018;The Diver&#x2019; (&#x2018;He is now on the surface, he&#x2019;s gasping for breath, so pale that he wants but the stillness of death&#x2019;), sung by Signor Foli in a terrifying and unnaturally low bass voice.</p><p>With foresight, or perhaps by luck, Farve converted the barn a few yards from the house into one large room with four bedrooms above and added a covered passage, &#x2018;the cloisters&#x2019;, to connect the two buildings. Tom and the older sisters lived in the barn, untroubled by grown-ups or babies, and made the most of their freedom. My father, who was famous for having read only one book, White Fang, which he enjoyed so much he vowed never to read another, entrusted Tom, aged ten, with the task of choosing which books to keep from the Batsford library. Nancy and Diana later said that if they had any education, it was due to the unrestricted access they had had to Grandfather&#x2019;s books at Asthall. Later, a grand piano arrived for Tom who showed great musical promise. Music and reading were his passions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The First World War was not long over and life for the survivors was limping back to normal. There was little to record in our family in the first few years of my life. Nancy went to Hatherop Castle, a finishing school nearby, and was taken to Paris with a group of friends, where she first saw the architecture and works of art that inspired in her a lifelong love of that city. She wrote enthusiastic letters to our mother about the shops, the food and the days spent at the Louvre. Pam busied herself with her ponies, pigs and dogs. Tom was at Lockers Park prep school in Hemel Hempstead. His orderly mind was already preparing for a career in the Law and he paid Nancy to argue with him all day during the holidays. Diana was an unwilling Girl Guide and played the organ in church, putting into practice her theory that &#x2018;Tea for Two&#x2019;, if played slowly enough, did very well as a voluntary.</p><p>The years at Asthall passed in a haze of contentment from my point of view. I was aware of The Others but they were so old and seemed to Decca (Jessica, my daily companion) and me to be of another world. It was not until later that I got to know them. Unity, next up in age from Decca and not yet in the schoolroom, made her huge presence felt but, although always kind to me, she was not an intimate. Our life in the nursery consisted of the daily round, the common task, secure and regular as clockwork.</p><p>At the age of five we started lessons with Muv, who followed the admirable Parents&#x2019; National Education Union (PNEU) system with its emphasis on learning through direct contact with nature and good books, and its disapproval of marks, prizes, rewards and exams. She taught us reading, writing and sums, and read us tales from the famous children&#x2019;s history book, Our Island Story. She was a natural teacher and never made anything seem too difficult. At the age of eight, I moved on to the schoolroom and a governess (trained at the PNEU&#x2019;s Ambleside College) and never enjoyed lessons again.</p><p>Our nursery windows overlooked the churchyard with its graves of wool merchants long since dead, the beautiful tombs topped with fleeces carved in stone. We were fascinated by funerals, which we were not meant to watch but of course we did. Decca and I once fell into a newly dug grave, to the delight of Nancy who pronounced fearful bad luck on us for ever. At that age, I was sure Farve would be buried by the path leading to our garden and even today I expect to see his big toe sticking up through the turf, which is what he warned me would happen if I misbehaved.</p><p>Beyond the churchyard to the left were stables, kennels and a garage. Early on at Asthall my father had a horrible accident in the stable yard: he was getting on to a young horse when it reared and fell backwards on to him, breaking his pelvis. The injury did not heal properly and, unable to throw his leg over a saddle, he never rode again. To the right of the churchyard was the vicarage. We adored the vicar&#x2019;s wife and long after we had left Asthall, Pam and I used to ride over and trot briskly up the drive, shouting for ginger biscuits. Across the road was the kitchen garden with its glasshouses and glorious white peaches, reserved strictly for grown-ups. Unity and our cousin Chris Bailey committed the heinous crime of sneaking into the greenhouse and stealing some peaches. There was a stony silence throughout the house while they were reprimanded by my father, which made a big effect on the younger ones. Farve has gone down in history as a violent man, mainly because of Nancy&#x2019;s portrayal of him as the irascible Uncle Matthew in her novels. While he could indeed get angry, he was never physically violent and his bark was far worse than his bite. We would tease him, goad him as far as we dared, until he turned and roared at us.</p><p>As soon as I could walk I shadowed Farve, struggling to keep up. He used to pick me up, throw me on to his shoulder and carry me over winter ditches and summer stinging nettles; the comforting feel of his velveteen waistcoat is inseparable from my memories of him. I must have been a great nuisance, but we saw eye to eye about everything. He took me fishing in the magic moment of the year when the mayfly were hatching and let me carry his net. As time went by, he showed me how to slide it under the hooked trout &#x2013; no talking, no jerking &#x2013; and land it on the bank. The sound of a reel when a line is cast on a trout rod equals early summer to me and the smell of newly cut grass, cow parsley, thrushes and &#x2018;All the birds of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire&#x2019; (Edward Thomas&#x2019;s Adlestrop is not far from Asthall) take me back to our stretch of the Windrush. No health, no safety, no handrail on the single planks that were our bridges as we crossed and recrossed over the river. It was paradise and I knew it. The river water had its own smell that rose from the easily stirred-up mud, and many years later when swimming among the weeds and mud in a pond high above Chatsworth, in the company of moorhens and mallard, nostalgia for the river at Asthall was almost too much and I was six again.</p><p>My father loved the river, described in the estate agent&#x2019;s brochure when Asthall was sold as &#x2018;of the most attractive character to a fisherman, including rapids, ge...</p></p><h2>Before Stalingrad: Barbarossa, Hitler's Invasion of Russia 1941 (Battles &amp; Campaigns)</h2><p>Operation Barbarossa&#x2014;as this campaign is famously called&#x2014;was arguably the greatest land campaign mankind has ever fought. Hitler named his assault after the 12th-century Frederick I Barbarossa, an emperor of the First Reich. Although he succeeded in capturing almost 40 percent of European Russia, Hitler was defeated there. Exploiting newly available Soviet archives, David M. Glantz challenges the time-honored explanation that poor weather, bad terrain, and Hitler&#x2019;s faulty strategic judgement produced the German defeat. He reveals how and why the Red Army thwarted Hitler&#x2019;s seemingly inexorable progress.</p><p></p><h2>Victory and Honor (Honor Bound, Book 6)</h2><p><b>The spectacular new book in <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling author W.E.B.

Just weeks after Hitler's suicide, Cletus Frade and his colleagues in the OSS find themselves up to their necks in battles every bit as fierce as the ones just ended. The first is political-the very survival of the OSS, with every department from Treasury to War to the FBI grabbing for its covert agents and assets. The second is on a much grander scale-the possible next world war, against Joe Stalin and his voracious ambitions. To get a jump on the latter, Frade has been conducting a secret operation, one of great daring-and great danger-but to conduct it and not be discovered, he and his men must walk a perilously dark line.

He then proceeded to a youth camp on the wooded island of Ut�ya, where he killed sixty-nine more, most of them teenage members of the country's governing Labour Party. In <i>One of Us</i>, the journalist �sne Seierstad tells the story of this terrible day and its reverberations. How did Breivik, a gifted child from an affluent neighborhood in Oslo, become Europe's most reviled terrorist? How did he accomplish an astonishing one-man murder spree? And how did a famously peaceful and prosperous country cope with the slaughter of so many of its young?</p><p>As in her international bestseller<i> The Bookseller of Kabul</i>, Seierstad excels at the vivid portraiture of lives under stress. She delves deep into Breivik's childhood, showing how a hip-hop and graffiti aficionado became a right-wing activist, a successful entrepreneur, and then an Internet game addict and self-styled master warrior who believed he could save Europe from the threat of Islam and multiculturalism. She writes with equal intimacy about Breivik's victims, tracing their political awakenings, teenage flirtations and hopes, and ill-fated journeys to the island. By the time Seierstad reaches Ut�ya and relates what happened there, we know both the killer and those he will kill. In the book's final act, Seierstad describes Breivik's tumultuous public trial. As Breivik took the stand and articulated his ideas, an entire country debated whether he should be deemed insane, and asked why a devastating sequence of police errors allowed one man to do so much harm.</p><p><i>One of Us</i> is at once a psychological study of violent extremism, a dramatic true crime procedural, and a compassionate inquiry into how a privileged society copes with homegrown evil. Lauded in Scandinavia for its literary merit and moral poise, <i>One of Us</i> is the true story of one of our age's most tragic events.</p></p><p><b>�sne</b> <b>Seierstad</b> is an award-winning Norwegian journalist and writer known for her work as a war correspondent.

She lives in Oslo, Norway.<p><b>Named among the Best Books of the Year by <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, NPR, <i>The Boston Globe</i>,<i> The Guardian</i>, <i>Buzzfeed</i>,<i> Publishers Weekly</i>, and <i>Men&#x2019;s Journal</i></b></p><p><b>Finalist for the New York Public Library's 2016 Helen Bernstein Book Award for Excellence in Journalism</b></p><p>&#x201c;<i>One of Us </i>has the feel of a nonfiction novel. Like Norman Mailer's <i>The Executioner's Song </i>and Truman Capote's<i> In Cold Blood</i>, it has an omniscient narrator who tells the story of brutal murders and, by implication, sheds light on the society partly responsible for them. Although those two books are beautifully written, I found <i>One of Us </i>to be more powerful and compelling . . . As Seierstad weaves the stories of Utoya's campers with her central narrative about Breivik-revealing the mundane details of their family lives, their youthful ambitions, idealism and naivet�-the book attains an almost unbearable weight. This tragedy isn't literary and symbolic; it's the real thing . . . Seierstad has written a remarkable book, full of sorrow and compassion.

After a long string of gray and rainy days, you appreciate seeing blue sky. But soon enough you realize the alarm didn&#x2019;t go off. You&#x2019;re disappointed because you&#x2019;ve been meaning to wake up extra early so you can have time to yourself before the kids wake up and the morning race begins. With what little time there is, you decide to skip your planned exercise routine, spend some more time in bed, and write in your journal. You write,<br><br><i>I can&#x2019;t believe I let myself down again by forgetting to set my alarm. How am I ever going to take charge of my days (and my<br>life!) if I can&#x2019;t make this simple change? Without exercise, I&#x2019;m going to feel like a slug today. Ugh.

You&#x2019;d have been out the door on time had your seven- year- old son not misplaced his favorite shoes. Then starts the parental nagging: &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t you just wear a different pair!? If those shoes are so important to you, why don&#x2019;t you keep better tabs on them?&#x201d; Now all four of you&#x2014; the kids, you, and your husband&#x2014; are racing around the house trying to find those @#$% shoes!<br><br>Later, having dropped the children off at school&#x2014; late again&#x2014;you arrive at work&#x2014; also late. The first person you see is Joe, your collaborator on the project that was just accepted. He&#x2019;s smiling broadly. At times you appreciate Joe&#x2019;s good spirits, but today his smile makes you suspicious. You think, <i>He&#x2019;s trying to butter me up so&nbsp;I&#x2019;ll do all the revisions! He approaches. &#x201c;Did you hear the news? We got the money! We&#x2019;re set for the year!&#x201d; You say, &#x201c;Yeah, but did you see that list of revisions&#x2014; and just forty- eight hours to make them? I&#x2019;ve also got to deal with Sharon&#x2019;s proposal this morning.&#x201d; Joe&#x2019;s smile fades as he takes a moment to figure out how to respond to your negativity.<br></i><br>***<br><br>Sound familiar? If you&#x2019;re like most people, you probably recognize this kind of morning all too well: <i>Can&#x2019;t do anything right. Can&#x2019;t give myself the time I need. Can&#x2019;t stick with my goal of journaling. Can&#x2019;t stand that Sharon is making her emergency my emergency. Can&#x2019;t fathom how I&#x2019;ll meet a forty- eight- hour revision deadline. Can&#x2019;t get on the same page with Joe. Can&#x2019;t even teach my kids to stay in bed until 7:00 a.m. Can&#x2019;t get through the morning &#x201c;race&#x201d; without yelling and fussing. Can&#x2019;t get the kids to school on time. And if I can&#x2019;t get myself to work on time&#x2014;how in the world am I going to meet all these demands?<br><br></i>We all know negativity; it looms large and is easy to spot. Negativity pervades your self- talk and your judgments. It bleeds into your exchanges with your kids and your colleagues, eroding goodwill between you. Making matters worse, unchecked negativity breeds healthdamaging negative emotions&#x2014; anger, contempt, and depression&#x2014; that seep into your entire body. You can feel your simmering bitterness eating away at your stomach, raising your blood pressure, and turning your shoulder and neck muscles to stone. Even your face feels hard and tight, which may be why others steer clear if they can. What&#x2019;s more, you move through your day as if you have blinders on. You find fault and blame everywhere. You see no solutions. Everything is painfully predictable. Negativity comes on fast and strong, hitting like a sledgehammer. And none of us is immune to it.<br><br>So what about positivity? Compared to negativity, positivity seems pale and weak. It&#x2019;s hardly the mirror image of negativity. Positivity seems so puny that at times we don&#x2019;t even notice it.<br><br>But what if positivity matters?<br><br>And what is positivity anyway?<br><br>Let&#x2019;s start with what it isn&#x2019;t. Positivity doesn&#x2019;t mean we should follow the axioms &#x201c;Grin and bear it&#x201d; or &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, be happy.&#x201d; Those are simply superficial wishes. Positivity runs deeper. It consists of the whole range of positive emotions&#x2014; from appreciation to love, from amusement to joy, from hope to gratitude, and then some. The term is<br>purposely broad. It includes the positive meanings and optimistic attitudes that trigger positive emotions as well as the open minds, tender hearts, relaxed limbs, and soft faces they usher in. It even includes the long- term impact that positive emotions have on your character, relationships, communities, and environment. Although some of this may sound like the vocabulary of greeting cards, the term <i>positivity</i> points to vital human moments that have now captured the interest of science. And the new scientific discoveries about the importance of positivity are stunning.<br><br>Your mild and fleeting pleasant states are far more potent than you think. We know now that they alter your mind and body in ways that can literally help you create your best life.<br><br>So let&#x2019;s roll back time and do a retake on that same morning of yours, this time with positivity. Rest assured that no matter how good you are at negativity, you&#x2019;re also capable of positivity. As you read, keep in mind that, like negativity, positivity goes beyond self- talk. Although subtle, it too infuses your mindscape and outlook, heart rhythms and body chemistry, muscle tension and facial expressions, and your resources and relationships.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Adoration Quilts: Applique Nativity Projects (That Patchwork Place)</h2><p>Stitch your way back to the origins of Christmas with inspiring designs based on the story of the Nativity.

Written in the age of the atom when America and Europe optimisitcally viewed the discovery of life on Mars as inevitable, Bradbury&#39;s 1940s short stories of a brutal, stark and unforgiving martian landscape were as shocking and visionary as they were insightful. &#39;The Martian Chronicles&#39; tells the story of humanity&#39;s repeated attempts to colonize the red planet. The first men were few. Most succumbed to a disease they called the Great Loneliness when they saw their home planet dwindle to the size of a pin dot. Those few that survived found no welcome. The shape-changing Martians thought they were native lunatics and duly locked them up. More rockets arrived from Earth, piercing the hallucinations projected by the Martians. People brought their old prejudices with them -- and their desires and fantasies, tainted dreams. These were soon inhabited by the strange native beings, with their caged flowers and birds of flame.</p><p>From "Rocket Summer" to "The Million-Year Picnic," Ray Bradbury's stories of the colonization of Mars form an eerie mesh of past and future. Written in the 1940s, the chronicles drip with nostalgic atmosphere--shady porches with tinkling pitchers of lemonade, grandfather clocks, chintz-covered sofas. But longing for this comfortable past proves dangerous in every way to Bradbury's characters--the golden-eyed Martians as well as the humans. Starting in the far-flung future of 1999, expedition after expedition leaves Earth to investigate Mars. The Martians guard their mysteries well, but they are decimated by the diseases that arrive with the rockets. Colonists appear, most with ideas no more lofty than starting a hot-dog stand, and with no respect for the culture they've displaced. <p> Bradbury's quiet exploration of a future that looks so much like the past is sprinkled with lighter material. In "The Silent Towns," the last man on Mars hears the phone ring and ends up on a comical blind date. But in most of these stories, Bradbury holds up a mirror to humanity that reflects a shameful treatment of "the other," yielding, time after time, a harvest of loneliness and isolation. Yet the collection ends with hope for renewal, as a colonist family turns away from the demise of the Earth towards a new future on Mars. Bradbury is a master fantasist and <i>The Martian Chronicles</i> are an unforgettable work of art. <i>--Blaise Selby</i></p>8 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Justice League Classic: Meet the Justice League (I Can Read Level 2)</h2><p><p>Kids who love DC Comics super heroes will be excited to see the Justice League fly into action in this I Can Read book!</p><p>The alien conqueror Starro has returned to enslave planet Earth.

By the time they started to, perhaps two hours later, hundreds of thousands of people were already out in the streets and gaping skyward. They shielded their eyes&#x2014;it was cloudy but very bright. They looked up at glowing things the size of cathedrals, looming above the skyline.<br><br> They&#x2019;d started as wisps, anomalies noticed only by dedicated weather-watchers. Slowly they&#x2019;d grown, started to glint in the early-winter afternoon. They solidified, their sides becoming more faceted, more opaquely white. They started to shed shadows.<br><br> Social media went mad with theories. The things were dismissed as mirages, hoaxes, advertising gimmicks for a TV show. They were heralded as angels, abominated as an alien attack or a new superweapon.<br><br> The first appeared over City Hall. This was plausibly a strategic target, which increased the sense of panic, though Parliament was only a few miles away and would have seemed a more obvious choice. Others quickly thickened into visibility over Lewisham and Elephant and Castle and up my way.<br><br> Some stayed still. Others began to drift slowly, seemingly randomly, according to their own currents, not the winds.<br><br> All but military flights over the city were banned. The army and specialist police units came onto the streets. Jets went low overhead, and bristling helicopters rose suspiciously and seemed to sniff at the sides and undersides of the eddying things.<br><br> I was about eleven&#x2014;this was almost fifteen years ago. There was me, Robbie, Sal&#x2014;she was big for her age and bossed the rest of us around a bit&#x2014;and Ian, a nervous kid to whom I wasn&#x2019;t nice.<br><br> We were under Mass 2, as it was later dubbed. It rocked sedately from side to side over the skies of Neasden as I and my friends ran in urgent delight around the gawping north Londoners. We ran to keep up with it, following it toward Harlesden. It seemed to be the most excitable of the visitations, heading east and south like an unstable ship.<br><br> From every one of the masses sank microclimates. We were all wearing our thickest clothes in the air that poured off them. It was like a bitterly cold wind flowing straight down, gusting with wispy snow.<br><br> It was all frenetic, it&#x2019;s hard to say just what happened when. I remember running really fast past the clock on Station Road, where it meets Wendover Road and Avenue Road, barreling by a woman in a black jilbaab and knocking her shopping over so she shouted at me furiously and I yelled something like &#x201c;Shut up you old cow!&#x201d; to make my friends laugh even though I knew I was in the wrong. It seems strange to me now that I remember that, that I took a moment to answer her, that she was so angry with me, that she even noticed me, in the shadow of what was overhead.<br><br> &#x201c;Look at that thing, man!&#x201d; Robbie said. Army vehicles went past the Portuguese caf�s and the Islamic bookshop.<br><br> We ran full pelt all the way to the West London Crematorium. As if they&#x2019;d have let a gang of raucous kids like us in to the grounds, normally, but they didn&#x2019;t care: everyone was pushing through the gates because the mass was right overhead. It rose above the gardens of remembrance. There must have been funerals going on that day, with hundreds of strangers in the garden, and that thing above.<br><br> People were trawling for information, watching the news on their phones, but by the time the government scientists announced the results of their tests (whatever they were and however they&#x2019;d taken them) their conclusions were obvious to everyone. We all knew that what hung above London were icebergs.<br><br> Military pilots made heroic maneuvers through the cold vortexes around the masses. Their undersides and flanks were frost- and snow-furred ice. On top, invisible from London until we saw the footage from the planes, jutting toward the lowest cloud, they were almost snowless. They were like white glass, hills and hillocks of blocky facets.<br><br> The city heat met their cold. On day two a frozen stalactite like a giant icicle broke off Mass 4 and plummeted to the ground, destroying a car in Dagenham and starting a whole new panic. I texted with my crew. We agreed to meet right below Mass 2 again. It was as if we were goading it. We were eleven and death couldn&#x2019;t touch us.<br><br> The berg had stopped above the common of Wormwood Scrubs. A line of police officers surrounded the grass. &#x201c;You ain&#x2019;t coming in,&#x201d; one said to us. The dirty parkland stretched behind him, overlooking London. Above it was the ice. We shivered in its shadow. I could hear the screams of London&#x2019;s feral parakeets freaking out in the trees.<br><br> We were debating how to slip past the cops but before an hour passed they took some instruction over their radios and did not so much usher us in as simply give up being guards. Mass 2 was on the move again. We went whooping after it.<br><br> After the fall of that first pillar people got nervous. There were instructions to stay indoors, as though it would be better to be crushed by a ruined house than by the ice itself. In fact the bergs were very solid. In the first week of their existence, only three slabs of any size came down, causing damage but no fatalities.<br><br> They weren&#x2019;t the only chunks to break off: they were the only ones to fall.<br><br> I was at Brent Cross Shopping Center with my mum and dad and my sister the first time I saw one of the icebergs break. It was a few days after their appearance and we were shopping for a football kit I needed. We were in the car-park and I was looking at Mass 4, I think it was, hovering miles away above Ealing. My dad told me to hurry up, and as he turned we heard a cracking. A chunk of ice the size of a building broke off the northern edge of the berg.<br><br> I gasped and my dad let out a horrified noise as the block toppled sideways, spinning&#x2014;and then stopped. It didn&#x2019;t fall&#x2014;it drifted away horizontally. It bobbed, spinning, leaving a little wake of suspended ice. We looked at each other.<br><br> The breakaway drifted back, and coagulated again with the main mass, a day and a half later.<br><br> It was two days post-manifestation that the first official government survey team made icefall. Scientists, professional explorers, a few international observers, an escort of Royal Marine commandos. In the press release, they all wore cutting-edge arctic gear and determined expressions.<br><br> They went for Mass 3. It had a horizontal plateau breaking up the slopes of its topside, onto which a helicopter could lower them. By now, all the icebergs had been given their own names, usually based on their silhouettes. The London Evening Standard declared this the &#x201c;ascent of the Saucepan.&#x201d; They live-streamed the delivery online, soldiers in thermal clothes lowered on swaying cables onto the pristine blowing surface of the ice, to make base camp almost a mile over Battersea.<br><br> Over the next five days we all followed the team&#x2019;s terse dispatches, their tweets and photographs, footage from their cameras, as Mass 3 itself described a wobbling circuit above the city. People leaned shivering out of their offices to look as it overflew. &#x201c;The Saucepan&#x201d; was escorted by military helicopters. If you were at a high point in the city looking out at the icebergs, you could see Mass 3 was surrounded with the specks of aircraft.<br><br> We read the reports of the team struggling up sides of ice, stared at the images they beamed down. Of course we were all caught up in the drama, and no one would deny how brave they were. Now, though, a few years on, so it&#x2019;s not like pissing in church any more to pass comment, it&#x2019;s fair to say that it was mostly the sort of thing you&#x2019;d expect from any arctic adventure. Freezing winds, terrible ice, so on.<br><br> I suppose I&#x2019;m saying that Mass 3, like all of them, is exactly what it looks like: an iceberg. No more, no less. Cold, austere, barren. Awesome, of course, because since when were icebergs not? But, and bear with me with this, except for the fact that it&#x2019;s levitating above London, it seems no more nor less awesome than its cousins in the sea.<br><br> There were, though, two exceptional images from that expedition. The first is the iconic shot of the team crossing an ice bridge between two forbidding white crags, with the slates and aerials of Wandsworth far below. The second is the selfie of Dr. Joanna Lund, taken close to the iceberg&#x2019;s summit.<br><br> Dr. Lund looks unhappily at the camera. She&#x2019;s slight, with squinting eyes circled in dark, her hat pulled down hard over her ears. Behind her is the pinnacle. You can just see the rest of the team at its base, looking up at the white blocks. There&#x2019;s the usual hard beauty of such landscapes. The city is not visible. The ice could be any ice. But there&#x2019;s a flat quality to the light and something in Lund&#x2019;s expression that makes the picture profoundly unsettling.<br><br> In the debriefing after the team&#x2019;s extraction, the government was keen to stress that they had, of course, considered the possibility that the icebergs might collide. If that was true, any protocols they had in place utterly failed.<br><br> On the morning of 17 June, the very day that last photo of Lund was released&#x2014;while, we were told, the team were attempting an ascent of that troublesome ice&#x2014;Mass 6, nicknamed Big Bear, began rolling with unusual speed across the skies, north away from Croydon.<br><br> At first this caused no particular alarm. But as the hours passed and Mass 6 accelerated, and as Mass 3&#x2019;s own sedate trajectory altered, it became obvious that the two were on a collision course.</p><h2>Marriage on the Rock</h2><p>Society requires years of preparation for almost any significant career endeavor, but demands no preparation for one of the most crucial undertakings in life: marriage.

Born in India as Dora Amy Elles, she began writing after the death of her first husband, publishing her first novel in 1910. In the 1920s, she introduced the character who would make her famous: Miss Maud Silver, the former governess whose stout figure, fondness for Tennyson, and passion for knitting served to disguise a keen intellect. Along with Agatha Christie s Miss Marple, Miss Silver is the definitive embodiment of the English style of cozy mysteries.<br>Very well written * Mary Stewart * . . . some of the best examples of the British country-house murder mystery * <i>Alfred Hitchcock Magazine</i> * Miss Silver has had her place in detective fiction as surely as Lord Peter Wimsey or Hercule Poirot * <i>Manchester Evening News</i> * Miss Wentworth is a first-rate storyteller * <i>Daily Telegraph</i> * Miss Silver is marvellous * <i>Daily Mail</i> * Praise for Patricia Wentworth:</p><h2>JFK and Vietnam: Deception, Intrigue, and the Struggle for Power</h2><p>Reveals the power struggle over the Vietnam War within the Kennedy administration and contends that the president&#39;s advisors conspired to push the U.S. into combat</p><p>Bold and authoritative revisionist analysis of Kennedy's Vietnam policy, by a US Army major who teaches history at the Univ. of Maryland. What was JFK's real agenda regarding Vietnam? Newman claims that the young President planned to withdraw American forces from that war-torn country--and his case is strong. The author pictures an isolated Kennedy battling both cold war jingoism and a military- industrial lobby avid for a war that would make tens of billions of dollars. Conventional wisdom generally sees JFK's early attacks on Eisenhower's covert liaison with France regarding Vietnam as simple political expediency, and Kennedy as another adherent to the domino theory. JFK's speeches buttress that position, but Newman, working with newly declassified material, argues that these speeches were simply requisite political twistings and turnings--and that Kennedy planned to get the US out of Vietnam despite a hawkish palace clique (led by Lyndon Johnson) that fed him disinformation on this most crucial foreign-policy issue. Document by document, incident by incident, the author reveals Kennedy as stranded within his own Administration, alienated by his desire to avoid this ultimate wrong-time, wrong-place war. Newman's research culminates in two crucial National Security Action Memos. In one, authored several weeks before Kennedy's death, the President formally endorsed withdrawal from Vietnam of a thousand advisors by the end of 1963 (to be followed by complete withdrawal by the end of 1965). In the second, written six days after the assassination, LBJ reversed the withdrawal policy and planned in some detail the escalation to follow. Crucial to any reevaluation of JFK as President and statesman, this electrifying report portrays a wily, stubborn, conflicted leader who grasped realities that eluded virtually everyone else in the US establishment. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Had he lived, would President Kennedy have committed U.S. troops to Vietnam? According to the evidence marshalled here, the answer is a resounding no. Newman, who teaches international politics at the University of Maryland, argues that when JFK went to Dallas he already intended to withdraw U.S. advisers from Vietnam, but held off to ensure his reelection in 1964. The book traces the president's pullout plan back to April '62, when he stated that the U.S. should seize every opportunity to reduce its commitment to Vietnam. A month later Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara asked U.S. generals in Saigon how soon the South Vietnamese would be ready to take over the war effort. This well-documented study shows that JFK was for a time deceived by Gen. Maxwell Taylor, head of the joint chiefs, and others in a blizzard of briefings that claimed unadulterated progress and success. Newman maintains that although the president paid public lip service to a continued commitment to appease the right, his goal was to abandon a venture that he early recognized as a lost cause. No other study has revealed so clearly how the tragedy in Dallas affected the course of the war in Vietnam, since two days after the assassination Lyndon Johnson signed a National Security Action Memo that opened the way for the fateful escalation of the war.

Toronto woke that morning to see itself cloaked and made over in white, and it was only November.</p><p>Cutting across Nathan Philips Square in front of the twin curves of the City Hall, Dave Martyniuk walked as carefully as he could and wished he&#x2019;d worn boots. As he maneuvered toward the restaurant entrance on the far side, he saw with some surprise that the other three were already waiting.</p><p>&#x201c;Dave,&#x201d; said sharp-eyed Kevin Laine. &#x201c;A new suit! When did this happen?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, everyone,&#x201d; Dave said. &#x201c;I got it last week. Can&#x2019;t wear the same corduroy jackets all year, can I?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A deep truth,&#x201d; said Kevin, grinning. He was wearing jeans and a sheepskin jacket. And boots. Having finished the obligatory apprenticeship with a law firm that Dave had just begun, Kevin was now immersed in the equally tedious if less formal six-month Bar Admission course. &#x201c;If that is a three-piece suit,&#x201d; he added, &#x201c;my image of you is going to be irrevocably shattered.&#x201d;</p><p>Wordlessly, Dave unbuttoned his overcoat to reveal the shattering navy vest beneath.</p><p>&#x201c;Angels and ministers of grace defend us!&#x201d; Kevin exclaimed, crossing himself with the wrong hand while making the sign against evil with the other. Paul Schafer laughed. &#x201c;Actually,&#x201d; Kevin said, &#x201c;it looks very nice. Why didn&#x2019;t you buy it in your size?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Kev, give him a break!&#x201d; Kim Ford said. &#x201c;It <i>is</i> nice, Dave, and it fits perfectly. Kevin&#x2019;s feeling scruffy and jealous.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am not,&#x201d; Kevin protested. &#x201c;I am simply giving my buddy a hard time. If I can&#x2019;t tease Dave, who can I tease?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; said Dave. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m tough, I can take it.&#x201d; But what he was remembering in that moment was the face of Kevin Laine the spring before, in a room in the Park Plaza Hotel. The face, and the flat, harshly mastered voice in which he&#x2019;d spoken, looking down at the wreckage of a woman on the floor:</p><p><i>&#x201c;To this I will make reply although he be a god and it mean my death.&#x201d;</i></p><p>You gave some latitude, Dave was thinking, to someone who&#x2019;d sworn an oath like that, even if his style was more than occasionally jarring. You gave latitude because what Kevin had done that evening was give voice, and not for the only time, to the mute rage in one&#x2019;s own heart.</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; said Kim Ford softly, and Dave knew that she was responding to his thought and not his flippant words. Which would have been unsettling, were she not who she was, with her white hair, the green bracelet on her wrist, and the red ring on her finger that had blazed to bring them home. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go in,&#x201d; Kim said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve things to talk about.&#x201d;</p><p>Paul Schafer, the Twiceborn, had already turned to lead them through the door.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>How many shadings, Kevin was thinking, are there to helplessness? He remembered the feeling from the year before, watching Paul twist inward on himself in the months after Rachel Kincaid had died. A bad time, that was. But Paul had come out of it, had gone so far in three nights on the Summer Tree in Fionavar that he was beyond understanding in the most important ways. He was healed, though, and Kevin held to that as a gift from Fionavar, some recompense for what had been done to Jennifer by the god named Rakoth Maugrim, the Unraveller. Though recompense was hardly the word; there was no true compensation to be found in this or any other world, only the hope of retribution, a flame so faint, despite what he had sworn, it scarcely burned. What were any of them against a god? Even Kim, with her Sight, even Paul, even Dave, who had changed among the Dalrei on the Plain and had found a horn in Pendaran Wood.</p><p>And who was he, Kevin Laine, to swear an oath of revenge? It all seemed so pathetic, so ridiculous, especially here, eating fillet of sole in the Mackenzie King Dining Room, amid the clink of cutlery and the lunchtime talk of lawyers and civil servants.</p><p>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; said Paul, in a tone that made their setting instantly irrelevant. He was looking at Kim. &#x201c;Have you seen anything?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stop that,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Stop pushing. If anything happens I&#x2019;ll tell you. Do you want it in writing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Easy, Kim,&#x201d; Kevin said. &#x201c;You have to understand how ignorant we feel. You&#x2019;re our only link.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m not linked to anything now, and that&#x2019;s all there is to it. There&#x2019;s a place I have to find and I can&#x2019;t control my dreaming. It&#x2019;s in this world, that&#x2019;s all I know, and I can&#x2019;t go anywhere or do anything until I find it. Do you think I&#x2019;m enjoying this any more than you three are?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you send us back?&#x201d; Dave asked, unwisely.</p><p>&#x201c;I am not a goddamned subway system!&#x201d; Kim snapped. &#x201c;I got us out because the Baelrath was somehow unleashed. I can&#x2019;t do it on command.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which means we&#x2019;re stuck here,&#x201d; Kevin said.</p><p>&#x201c;Unless Loren comes for us,&#x201d; Dave amended.</p><p>Paul was shaking his head. &#x201c;He won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Dave asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Loren&#x2019;s playing hands-off, I think. He set things in motion, but he&#x2019;s leaving it up to us now, and some of the others.&#x201d;</p><p>Kim was nodding. &#x201c;He put a thread in the loom,&#x201d; she murmured, &#x201c;but he won&#x2019;t weave this tapestry.&#x201d; She and Paul exchanged a glance.</p><p>&#x201c;But why?&#x201d; Dave persisted. Kevin could hear the big man&#x2019;s frustration. &#x201c;He needs us&#x2014;or at least Kim and Paul. Why won&#x2019;t he come for us?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because of Jennifer,&#x201d; said Paul quietly. After a moment he went on. &#x201c;He thinks we&#x2019;ve suffered enough. He won&#x2019;t impose anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>Kevin cleared his throat. &#x201c;As I understand it, though, whatever happens in Fionavar is going to be reflected here and in the other worlds too, wherever they are. Isn&#x2019;t that true?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is,&#x201d; said Kim calmly. &#x201c;It is true. Not immediately, perhaps, but if Rakoth takes dominion in Fionavar he takes dominion everywhere. There is only one Tapestry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Even so,&#x201d; said Paul, &#x201c;we have to do it on our own. Loren won&#x2019;t demand it. If the four of us want to go back, we&#x2019;ll have to find a way ourselves.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The four of us?&#x201d; Kevin said. So much helplessness. He looked at Kim.</p><p>There were tears in her eyes. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t know. She won&#x2019;t see the three of you. She never goes out of the house. She talks to me about work and the weather, and the news, and she&#x2019;s, she&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s going ahead with it,&#x201d; Paul Schafer said.</p><p>Kimberly nodded.</p><p>Golden, she had been, Kevin remembered, from inside the sorrow.</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; said Paul. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my turn now.&#x201d;</p><p>Arrow of the God.</p><p>She&#x2019;d had a peephole placed in the door so she could see who was knocking. She was home most of the day, except for afternoon walks in the park nearby. There were often people at the door: deliveries, the gas man, registered mail. For a while at the beginning there had been, fatuously, flowers. She&#x2019;d thought Kevin was smarter than that. She didn&#x2019;t care whether or not that was a fair judgment. She&#x2019;d had a fight with Kim about it, when her roommate had come home one evening to find roses in the garbage can.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you have any idea how he&#x2019;s feeling? Don&#x2019;t you care?&#x201d; Kimberly had shouted.</p><p>Answer: no, and no.</p><p>How could she come to such a human thing as caring, anymore? Numberless, the unbridged chasms between where she now was, and the four of them, and everyone else. To everything there yet clung the odor of the swan. She saw the world through the filtered unlight of Starkadh. What voice, what eyes seen through that green distortion, could efface the power of Rakoth, who had shoveled through her mind and body as if she, who had once been loved and whole, were so much slag?</p><p>She knew she was sane, did not know why.</p><p>One thing only pulled her forward into some future tense. Not a good thing, nor could it have been, but it was real, and random, and hers. She would not be gainsaid.</p><p>And so, when Kim had first told the other three, and they had come in July to argue with her, she had stood up and left the room. Nor had she seen Kevin or Dave or Paul since that day.</p><p>She would bear this child, the child of Rakoth Maugrim. She intended to die giving birth.</p><p>She would not have let him in, except that she saw that he was alone, and this was sufficiently unexpected to cause her to open the door.</p><p>Paul Schafer said, &#x201c;I have a story to tell. Will you listen?&#x201d;</p><p>It was cold on the porch. After a moment she stepped aside and he entered. She closed the door and walked into the living room. He hung up his coat in the hall closet and followed her.</p><p>She had taken the rocking chair. He sat down on the couch and looked at her, tall and fair, still graceful though no longer slim, seven months heavy with the child. Her head was high, her wide-set green eyes uncompromising.</p><p>&#x201c;I walked away from you last time, and I will again, Paul. I will not be moved on this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I said, a story,&#x201d; he murmured.</p><p>&#x201c;Then tell it.&#x201d;</p><p>So he told her for the first time about the grey dog on the wall of Paras Derval and the fathomless sorrow in its eyes; he told her about his second night on the Summer Tree, when Galadan, whom she also knew, had come for him, and how the dog had appeared again, and of the battle fought here in the M�rnirwood. He told her about being bound on the Tree of the God, and seeing the red moon rise and the grey dog drive the wolf from the wood.</p><p>He told her of Dana. And M�rnir. The powers shown forth that night in answer to the Darkness in the north. His voice was deeper than she remembered; there were echoes in it.</p><p>He said, &#x201c;We are not in this alone. He may break us into fragments in the end, but he will not be unresisted, and whatever you may have seen or endured in that place you must understand that he cannot shape the pattern exactly to his desire. Or else you would not be here.&#x201d;</p><p>She listened, almost against her will. His words brought back words of her own, spoken in Starkadh itself: <i>You will have nothing of me that you do not take</i>, she had said. But that was before. Before he had set about taking everything&#x2014;until Kim had pulled her out.</p><p>She lifted her head a little. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Paul said, his eyes never leaving her face. &#x201c;Do you understand? He is stronger than any of us, stronger even than the God who sent me back. He is stronger than you, Jennifer; it is not worth saying except for this: he cannot take away what you are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know this,&#x201d; said Jennifer Lowell. &#x201c;It is why I will bear his child.&#x201d;</p><p>He sat back. &#x201c;Then you become his servant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. You listen to me now, Paul, because you don&#x2019;t know everything either. When he left me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;after, he gave me to a Dwarf. Bl�d was his name. I was a reward, a toy, but he said something to the Dwarf: he said I was to be killed, <i>and that there was a reason.</i>&#x201d; There was cold resolution in her voice. &#x201c;I will bear this child because I am alive when he wished me dead&#x2014;the child is random, it is outside his purposes.&#x201d;</p><p>He was silent a long time. Then, &#x201c;But so are you, in and of yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>Her laugh was a brutal sound. &#x201c;And how am I, in and of myself, to answer him? I am going to have a son, Paul, and he will be my answer.&#x201d;</p><p>He shook his head. &#x201c;There is too much evil in this, and only to prove a point already proven.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nonetheless,&#x201d; said Jennifer.</p><p>After a moment his mouth crooked sideways. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t press you on it, then. I came for you, not him. Kim&#x2019;s already dreamt his name, anyhow.&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes flashed. &#x201c;Paul, understand me. I would do what I am doing whatever Kim said. Whatever she happened to dream. And I will name him as I choose!&#x201d;</p><p>He was smiling, improbably. &#x201c;Stick around and do that then. Stay with us, Jen. We need you back.&#x201d; Only when he spoke did she realize what she&#x2019;d said. He&#x2019;d tricked her, she decided, had goaded her quite deliberately into something unintended. But she couldn&#x2019;t, for some reason, feel angry. Had this first tenuous spar he&#x2019;d thrown across to her been a little firmer she might, in fact, have smiled.</p><p>Paul stood up. &#x201c;There is an exhibition of Japanese prints at the Art Gallery. Would you like to see it with me?&#x201d;</p><p>For a long time she rocked in the chair, looking up at him. He was dark-haired, slight, still frail-seeming, though not so much as last spring.</p><p>&#x201c;What was the dog&#x2019;s name?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I wish I did.&#x201d;</p><p>After another moment she rose, put on her coat, and took her first careful step on the first bridge.</p><p>Dark seed of a dark god, Paul was thinking, as he tried to simulate an interest in nineteenth-century prints from Kyoto and Osaka. Cranes, twisted trees, elegant ladies with long pins in their hair.</p><p>The lady beside him wasn&#x2019;t talking a great deal, but she was there in the gallery, and it was not a small grace. He remembered the crumpled figure she had been seven months before, when Kim had brought them desperately from Fionavar with the wild, blazing power of the Baelrath.</p><p>This was Kim&#x2019;s power, he knew: the Warstone and the dreams in which she walked at night, white-haired as Ysanne had been, two souls within her, and knowledge of two worlds. It had to be a difficult thing. <i>The price of power</i>, he remembered Ailell the High King telling him, the night they played their game of ta&#x2019;bael. The night that had been overture to the three nights that became his own hard, hardest thing. The gateway to whatever he now was, Lord of the Summer Tree.</p><p>Whatever he now was. They had moved into the twentieth century now: more cranes, long, narrow mountain scenes, low boats riding on wide rivers.</p><p>&#x201c;The themes don&#x2019;t change much,&#x201d; Jennifer said.</p><p>&#x201c;Not much.&#x201d;</p><p>He had been sent back, he was M�rnir&#x2019;s response, but he had no ring with which to burn, no dreams down which to track the secrets of the Tapestry, not even a horn such as Dave had found, no skylore like Loren, or crown like Aileron; not even&#x2014;though he felt a chill at the thought&#x2014;a child within him like the woman at his side.</p><p>And yet. There had been ravens at his shoulder in the branches of the Tree: Thought and Memory were their names. There had been a figure in the clearing, hard to see, but he had seen horns on its head and seen it bow to him. There had been the white mist rising up through him to the sky in which a red moon sailed on new moon night. There had been rain. And then the God.</p><p>And there was still the God. At night, sometimes, he could feel the tacit presence, immense, in the rush and slide of his blood, the muffled thunder of his human heart.</p><p>Was he a symbol only? A manifestation of what he had been telling Jennifer: the presence of opposition to the workings of the Unraveller? There were worse roles, he supposed. It gave him a part to play in what was to come, but something within&#x2014;and there was a god within him&#x2014;said that there was more. <i>No man shall be Lord of the Summer Tree who has not twice been born</i>, Jaelle had said to him in the sanctuary.</p><p>He was more than symbol. The waiting to learn what, and how, seemed to be part of the price.</p><p>Almost at the end now. They stopped in front of a large print of a river scene: boats being poled along, others unloading at a crowded dock; there were woods on the far side of the stream, snowcapped mountains beyond.

Ha publicado en el boletin &#39;Leadership Journal&#39;.Leadership 101: An Interactive Leadership Development Guide for Students CHAPTER ONE WHAT IS LEADERSHIP? Peter ate heartily as the conversation continued around him. Some were talking about the authoritative way that Jesus had overturned the trading tables in the court of the Gentiles. Others were making plans for the future now that the tide had turned for them. Unnoticed in the midst of the hubbub, the Master rose and made his way out of the room. He reappeared several minutes later, his chest bare and a towel wrapped around his waist. Walking deliberately over to the corner, he poured fresh water into a clay basin. As Jesus picked up the basin, an abrupt silence fell upon the group. Peter wondered what the Master was doing now. Jesus looked for all the world like a common servant. He knelt in front of Judas and motioned for him to place his foot in the basin. Judas looked terribly uncomfortable as the Master began to wash his feet. As the Master continued, Judas&#39; discomfort turned into agitation. All eyes in the room were fixed on Jesus. What was this all about? The men watched Jesus pour a dipper of water over Judas&#39; feet and then tenderly wipe them dry with the towel he had wrapped around his waist. The Master carried the basin to the next person, John. As he bent down to wash John&#39;s feet, he spoke lovingly: &#39;You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.&#39; Peter was repelled by the scene. Th is was their Master, the one they were calling the new King of Israel, and he was on his knees washing their feet as if he were the lowliest servant in the household! There was no way he, Peter, would lower himself to do the job of a common servant. Peter was next in line, and he could see it coming. But Peter wanted none of it. Embarrassment aside, it just wasn&#39;t right! No man---least of all a man with the importance of the Master---should have to wash his followers&#39; feet. That&#39;s what servants were for. The master dried John&#39;s feet and pushed the basin toward Peter. &#39;No,&#39; Peter said firmly, looking straight into the Master&#39;s eyes. &#39;You will never wash my feet.&#39; Jesus looked up at Peter&#39;s face. Gently and patiently he said, &#39;Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.&#39; The room was quiet. Outside, the laughter of children could be heard. Peter sat stiffly. He knew he must be missing something. Then, slowly at first, past conversations came to Peter&#39;s mind. The last shall be first. Except you become as a child. He who would be great among you must be your servant. Illumination began to flood Peter. This wasn&#39;t really about washing dirty feet. It was about humility, about taking the lesser path, even when glory was in sight. Now he understood what the Master was doing! &#39;Peter, if I do not wash your feet, you can have no part with me,&#39; the Master repeated. Peter&#39;s reply was barely audible to the others: &#39;Then, Lord, not just my feet but my hands and my head as well.&#39; As Peter spoke, the resistance seemed to seep out of him. Peter sat quietly and allowed Jesus to minister to him while the other disciples watched in studied silence. Finally, the Master was done. He rose to his feet, rubbing his back. Then he spoke to all the disciples: &#39;Do you understand what I have done for you? You call me &#39;Teacher&#39; and &#39;Lord,&#39; and rightly so, for that is what I am. Now that I, your Lord the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another&#39;s feet. I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.&#39; ---from The Leadership Paradox by Denny Gunderson LEADERSHIP Okay, you&#39;ve heard the word, but what does it mean? Leadership is a term that defies description. According to John Maxwell, a renowned leadership expert, there are currently 350 working definitions of the word in current literature. Three hundred and fifty definitions! Still, most people say it&#39;s a term they understand. But do we really? Let&#39;s play with this idea for a little while. How would you define the word leadership? Pretty hard, isn&#39;t it? The trouble is, almost every time you settle on a definition, you can think of an exception to it. Look at the definitions in the outer margin. Circle the one(s) you agree with most. DEFINE LEADERSHIP Do an Internet search for the word leadership. How many sites did you find? Do any of them define leadership? Write out three of the best definitions you found online--- 1. 2. 3. TAKE IT DEEPER LEADERS IN MY LIFE Th ink about the people you consider leaders. List the fi rst three who come to mind. 1. 2. 3. What makes you consider each person you listed a leader? After each name list the leadership qualities you&#39;ve observed in that person. List three people who&#39;ve had the most impact on your life. (This could include people you don&#39;t know personally.) 1. 2. 3. Beside each of these three names list the person&#39;s qualities that have influenced you the most. Were the people you included on your first list different from the ones on your second list? If so, when you thought of leaders, why didn&#39;t you think of people in your life who have influenced you? Have you bought into the world&#39;s perspective that leadership is about being in charge? We often believe leaders are the ones at the top. Of course, that can be part of what leadership is---but don&#39;t be lulled into thinking that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about. One of the people I&#39;d include on my second list is Sharon, a neighbor of mine while I was growing up. When I was a sophomore in high school, I reached my lowest point in a string of poor choices and needed to live away from home for a while. Sharon and her husband took me in. Sharon changed my life. She loved me despite the choices I&#39;d made. She set clear boundaries for me---certain behaviors had to begin, certain friends had to go. Then she did the most amazing thing. She put her arms around me and wept with me as I grieved the loss of the things I had to let go. As I tried to make some hard changes during the next few months, Sharon kept reminding me about my incredible future and the things I could do well; she encouraged me to step out and take some risks. She continually spoke truth to me about who God was and how he viewed me. Sharon was a housewife with three kids in Ada, Michigan. You&#39;ll probably never meet her or hear her name on the news, but Sharon was one of the most powerful leaders in my life. I wanted to be just like her. Her life and her actions influenced me to make some major changes---changes that in part led me to the place where I am today. That&#39;s great leadership!</p><h2>The Inn at Eagle Hill: 3-in-1 Collection</h2><p>The Inn at Eagle Hill: 3-in-1 Collection [Paperback] [Sep 06, 2016] Fisher, S...</p><p><b>Suzanne Woods Fisher</b> is an award-winning, bestselling author of more than two dozen novels, including <i>Anna's Crossing</i>, <i>The Newcomer</i>, and <i>The Return </i>in the Amish Beginnings series, The Bishop's Family series, and The Inn at Eagle Hill series, as well as nonfiction books about the Amish, including <i>Amish Peace</i> and <i>The Heart of the Amish</i>.

His long list of credits includes Batman: Arkham Asylum, JLA, Seven Soldiers, Animal Man, Doom Patrol, The Invisibles and The Filth. He is currently writing Batman and All-Star Superman Frank Quitely has won acclaim for his work on high-profile titles including We3, JLA: Earth 2, The Authority, and New X-Men.Morrison, Quitely and Grant conclude their fresh and compelling take on the most iconic superhero in comics. Recently, grittier modern-day reinterpretations of classic characters, set outside normal continuity, have become the popular way to do a limited series such as this one. Morrison's Superman, however, is the same defender of truth, justice and the American way recognizable to generations of comics readers. Now, however, his days are numbered. Slowly dying from overexposure to solar radiation, Superman is faced with the dilemma of how to do the most good in his final days and how to prepare the people and planet he loves to carry on without him. Morrison's feverish style is both a blessing and a curse, as the overwhelming deluge of ideas thrown at the reader confuses even while creating a parallel with Superman's own constant supersensory information overload. Yet Morrison's writing recaptures the sense of simple wonder and virtue essential to a classic Superman tale. Quitely and Grant's art is evocative of the earliest images of the character, a refined evolution of the bright costumes, skylines and chiseled jaws that adds a dignity and humanity to the characters beyond their cartoonish origins. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The account is not a chronological narration of the events that took place to form India, but the narration of the story of India. Romila Thapar s version of the history of India is composed of many stories of the different parts of India which gradually came together to form one great country. <br><br> Romila Thapar s The Penguin History Of Early India From The Origins To AD 1300 takes its readers on a journey. The journey begins from the prehistoric era of the Indus Valley Civilization and other such ancient civilizations. It continues through to the emergence of the great empires of the Mauryas, Cholas, and the Guptas. It also talks about the creation of the great epics of The Ramayana and The Mahabharata, and the lives of great scholars and saints who had a huge impact on the life of India and its people such as Gautam Buddha and King Ashoka.

Original.</p><p>Perennial favorite Debbie Macomber does what she does best in <i>16 Lighthouse Road</i>, introducing fans to the scenic Pacific Northwest town of Cedar Cove, Washington, and its panoply of characters, including family court judge Olivia Lockhart who makes news when she denies the divorce petition of Cecilia and Ian Randall. Decreeing that the young couple had not tried hard enough to make their relationship work following the tragic death of their newborn daughter, Olivia's decision brings her to the attention of recent Cedar Cove arrival, newspaper editor Jack Griffin. And Jack's attentions are not entirely unwelcome for the long-divorced Olivia. In addition to her continued involvement in Cecilia and Ian's ongoing negotiations, Olivia's life is further complicated by her mother, Charlotte, her daughter, Justine, and her best friend, Grace, as they struggle with the difficult situations life tosses their way. Charlotte becomes enmeshed in trying to solve a mystery left to her by a mute stroke victim she befriends just before he dies. Justine has found the perfect man for her, one who shares her ambitions and thoughts on relationships, but why does she keep thinking about the boy she knew in high school who has grown into quite a man? And Grace's husband, Dan, has disappeared--again--and Grace has no idea where he is and when or if he'll be back. The multiple story lines and numerous relationships make reading at times challenging, but Macomber fans, old and new, will stand up and cheer as the prolific author lodges her protest against the disposable personal relationships all too common today. <i>--Alison Trinkle</i>Debbie Macomber, the author of&nbsp; <i>Hannah's List, Summer on Blossom Street, Twenty Wishes</i> and the Cedar Cove series, is one of today's leading voices in women's fiction.

The first Seuss title to feature full-color art on every other page, this adventurous picture book tells of Marco-who first imagined an extraordinary parade in <i>And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street</i>-as he daydreams of all the possibilities that await him while he fishes in McElligot's Pool. Optimistic and exciting, this tale is the perfect bait, and readers young and old will be hooked on this fish-tastic favorite.</p><p><i>McElligot's Pool</i> is a Seuss classic from the distant era before even <i>The Cat In The Hat</i>. It's a single poetic variation on the theme of adult skepticism that's no match for childhood faith and daydreaming. A small boy is fishing in the tiny, unpromising McElligot's Pool, a puddle that (as a passing farmer informs our diminutive hero) is nothing but a hole where people dispose of their junk. But the boy is all optimism: what if the pool is deeper than anyone thinks? What if it connects to an underground stream that flows under the town to the sea? Might not all sorts of fish then swim up the stream and be caught here? "I might catch an eel... (Well, I might. It depends.) A long twisting eel with a lot of strange bends. And, oddly enough, with a head at both ends!" The moral of the story is straightforward: "If I wait long enough, if I'm patient and cool,/ Who knows what I'll catch in McElligot's pool?" (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Richard Farr</i>"Rare and wonderful imaginings are told in the author-artist's inimitable rhyme and are shown in hilariously funny pictures."--<i>Booklist.</i></p><h2>Blood Stains (The Searchers, 1)</h2><p><br><br>At the reading of her father's will, Maria Slade receives shocking news&#x2014;as a four-year-old, she'd witnessed her prostitute mother's murder and been taken into hiding by the well-meaning preacher who'd raised her as his own.<br><br>Maria remembers none of that. But now she's determined to flush her mother's killer out of hiding and discover the identity of her birth father. She heads to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where she meets Detective Bodie Scott.<br><br>Empathizing with this beautiful woman looking to find out who she really is, he opens the decades-old case file. Their investigation leads them down a dangerous path, where no one is what they seem. Where a father does not want to be found.

Centennial Award for 100th published novel.<br><br>The dark mound of dirt in the Slade family cemetery marked the final resting place of family patriarch Andrew Slade. Flowers that had been placed on the grave three days earlier were already shriveled from the chill Montana spring. He had been buried beside his loving wife, Hannah, on the Montana ranch that had been his solace, and no amount of weeping or praying could change the fact that he was dead. Although, if that had been possible, he would already have been resurrected.<br><br>His three daughters had been blindsided by his passing and were still dealing with the devastation.<br><br>The doctor called it an aneurysm.<br><br>His daughters called it a tragedy.<br><br>But they'd been raised to endure, and even though their hearts were broken, they were tending to business, just as they'd been taught.<br><br>At the age of twenty-four years, Maria Slade was not the oldest, but she'd always been the leader, and today she was doing her best to keep her sisters' emotions intact.<br><br>All three still lived on the property. Maria was the one who thrived outdoors, who had ridden the ranch with her father and their foreman, Bud, and was also her father's best friend. She came alive outdoors, could rope and ride as well as any hired hand, and had recently taken up training horses as her chosen profession.<br><br>Savannah was the youngest, but a whiz with math. She kept the books, both for the ranch and its horse and cattle breeding program, without a hitch.<br><br>Holly was the homemaker. When Hannah died, she'd stepped into the breach and kept the cupboards full and the house spotless, and had hosted their annual barbeque as if she'd been born to the job.<br><br>Within the hour, they would be going to Missoula for the reading of the will. It marked the finality of their father's passing, and for that reason alone, Andrew's daughters were dragging their heels.<br><br>Because Maria had always taken the lead, she was rushing to get ready, knowing it would be her responsibility to get everyone and everything in place so they could leave.<br><br>She glanced at herself in the mirror, giving her appearance one last appraisal. Dark hair brushed. Brown slacks, jade-colored blouse and suede jacket&#x2014;subdued enough for the occasion but still comfortable for the chill of the day. Chocolate-brown boots in case of rain.<br><br>She squinted, testing to see if that would hide the fact that her eyes were still red from a morning bout of weeping, and then sighed. Why hide the fact that she was grieving? Everyone knew it. Taking a deep breath, she pivoted sharply on one heel and stalked out of the room.<br><br>As she was going down the hall, she heard the front door open, then close with a thud. That would be Bud coming to tell them he'd brought the car around. Bud's diligence over the past few days had helped them through many rough patches. She knew he was grieving for their father as deeply as they were. He and Andrew had been good friends long before Bud had come to work at the ranch, and working together all these years had only deepened the tie.<br><br>As she reached Savannah's door, she knocked sharply and called out, "Bud's here. We need to go."<br><br>"Coming," Savannah answered.<br><br>Maria moved down the hall to the last door and repeated the process.<br><br>"Holly! Bud's here."<br><br>The door opened immediately.<br><br>"I'm ready," Holly said, and fell into step beside her sister. A moment later, a door opened behind them and Savannah ran to catch up.<br><br>They entered the living room in tandem, their shoulders stiff, their chins raised as if bracing for another blow.<br><br>Bud was waiting for them. "The wind is sharp and it looks like rain. You might want to get some rain gear."<br><br>"We aren't made of sugar. We won't melt," Maria muttered.<br><br>Savannah stifled a sob and reached for Maria's hand.<br><br>Holly's chin quivered. "That's what Dad always said."<br><br>"Don't say I didn't warn you," Bud muttered, then spun on his heel and opened the door for them.<br><br>As the women grabbed their coats from the hall closet, they cast guilty glances at the firm set of his jaw. Maria reminded herself again that Bud was grieving, too.<br><br>"Sorry," she said, and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek as she walked past.<br><br>He hugged her back as an apology for his gruffness. "No need to apologize, sugar. We're all pretty raw."<br><br>Savannah laid her hand briefly on his forearm and gave it a squeeze.<br><br>Holly's gaze locked on his as she passed, then she blinked and turned away.<br><br>No one spoke as they got settled, and Bud put the car in gear and drove away from the ranch. It was too reminiscent of the feelings they'd had on the way to Andrew Slade's funeral. To add credence to Bud's warning, it began to rain before they got to the cattle guard at the end of the driveway.<br><br>Cattle stood in bunches with their heads down, their hindquarters turned toward the blowing rain. Andrew's quarter horse, Red, was tossing his head and neighing sharply as he circled the corral in a trot. He'd been acting up ever since Andrew's death. They had all been around animals long enough to know that the horse knew its master was gone and was as lost as the rest of them were.<br><br>Despite the rain that had begun to fall, the ranch hands who were fixing a break in the fence took off their hats as the car passed by them...honoring the family and the man who had been their boss. They were concerned, too, but for different reasons. They didn't know what would be happening to the Triple S. Would they still have jobs when this day was over?<br><br>A lone buzzard had perched on the crossbar over the entrance gate, waiting for a lull between gusts of the sharp north wind before taking flight. The intermittent sprinkle of accompanying moisture was more sleet than rain, a fitting reflection of the mood of the people inside the car as it passed beneath the buzzard's perch. The rattling sound of the car passing over the cattle guard sent the bird into the air, and as the car disappeared from sight, so did the ungainly scavenger.<br><br>Coleman Rice kept glancing at the clock and then back at the stack of paperwork on his desk as he paced his office. The Slade family was due to arrive at any moment, and he was dreading what was to come. In all his years as an attorney, Andrew Slade's will was certainly the most shocking he'd ever encountered. The information was so volatile that he had no idea how the women were going to react. He smoothed the hair down on both sides of his head and straightened his jacket just as he heard a commotion in the outer office. They were here.<br><br>He took a deep breath and unconsciously threw back his shoulders, as if bracing for what was to come. The door opened.<br><br>His secretary, Milly, announced unnecessarily, "The Slade family is here."<br><br>Coleman walked toward them, his hand extended.<br><br>"Ladies...Bud...I'm sorry to be seeing you under these circumstance. Please come in."<br><br>He had chairs arranged in a semicircle around the front of his desk, with a small, flat-screen TV on the bookshelf behind his chair.<br><br>"Take a seat," he said, gesturing toward the setting he'd arranged.<br><br>Bud seated the women, then took the last chair for himself. Once they had settled, Coleman got down to business.<br><br>"As you know...we're here today to read the last will and testament of Andrew Slade. It's brief and to the point, so I'll read it first. And then there's a video Andrew recorded for the four of you to see."<br><br>"Oh, no," Savannah muttered.<br><br>Maria took her hand. Holly took the other. The sisters sat quietly, bound by love and circumstance, while Bud looked as if he were wishing for this morning to be over.<br><br>"The dispersal of the property is straightforward," Coleman said, and proceeded to read through the where-ases and wherefores.<br><br>Maria began losing focus. Then she heard the lawyer clear his throat and tuned back in.<br><br>"The ranch will be left in equal parts to my daughters, Holly, Maria and Savannah, and to my treasured friend and foreman, Robert Tate."<br><br>Bud gasped. "No. That's not right. I didn't expect... he shouldn't have...it belongs to the&#x2014;"<br><br>"Hush, Bud," Maria said sharply. "It <em>is </em>right. He did the exact right thing. We're family. All four of us&#x2014;and we can't run the place without you."<br><br>Bud sat back, clearly stunned by the news.<br><br>Coleman held up his hand. "Let me finish."<br><br>The room got quiet.<br><br>"Besides the property and monies...there's the message Andrew left. Ladies, I will preface it by saying. it has nothing to do with what you've inherited&#x2014;but it has everything to do with the rest of your lives."<br><br>The sisters glanced at each other, then at Bud.<br><br>He shrugged, as if to say he knew nothing about this. "Should I leave?" he asked.<br><br>Once again, Maria took charge. "No. You stay." Then she softened her voice as she added, "Please."<br><br>Bud nodded, then settled back in his seat, and they all watched as the lawyer slipped a disc into the player, hit a button, then left the room.<br><br>Andrew Slade's face appeared on the screen at the same time the door closed.<br><br>Breaths caught in unison, then they all exhaled softly as they braced themselves for whatever he had to say.<br><br>"Hello, my daughters. Obviously, if you're seeing this, I have passed on. Know that, while I am sorry to be leaving you behind, my faith in God and the knowledge that I will be with my beloved Hannah again is, for me, a cause to rejoice. However, what I have to say to you is something I've dreaded your entire lives, and I'm ashamed to say I chose the easy way out and left it for you to hear after my passing."<br><br>Unconsciously, the sisters leaned into each other. Maria noticed as Bud almost unconsciously slid an arm behind Holly's chair, as if bracing her against what was clearly going to be bad news. There was a muscle jerking at the side of Andrew's jaw as he faced the camera, which told her that her father had been under stress when he recorded his message. But she could not have imagined, in her wildest dreams, the words that came out of his mouth.<br><br>"My darling daughters.you need to know that I am not really your father. Hannah was not really your mother, nor were any of you ever legally adopted."<br><br>Shock spread across all three women's faces.<br><br>"What the hell?" Bud muttered, unable to believe what he was hearing.<br><br>"There is more," Andrew added. "You are not sisters."<br><br>Maria gasped. Holly moaned. Savannah began to weep.<br><br>Bud's arm tightened around Holly's shoulders.<br><br>The sisters looked at each other in mute disbelief, then Maria gently squeezed one of Savannah's hands as Holly did the same to the other.<br><br>"We <em>are </em>sisters&#x2014;in every way that counts," Maria said sharply.<br><br>Andrew's voice drew their focus back to the screen.<br><br>"By now, I suspect your grief at my passing has turned to shock...even anger. I understand. But what you three need to understand is.I believed with every fiber of my being that, as I was following my calling as an evangelical preacher, God led me to each of you at a time when you needed me most. There are journals that I've left with Coleman, one for each of you. Everything I know about your past is in there, along with why your mothers put you in my care.<br><br>"Maria, you were the first one. You were born Mary Blake, in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Your mother had a hard life. She was, for lack of a better word, an escort at the time of her death. You were four years old when you witnessed her murder. As she lay dying, she begged me to take you and hide you. The details as to how it all happened are in your journal. To my knowledge, her murder was never solved.<br><br>"Savannah, you are actually Sarah Stewart from Miami, Florida, and the second child to be given to me. Your mother was dying of cancer and had come to my tent meetings to pray for healing. By then, Maria had been with me for nearly six months. You were barely two. You and Maria hit it off immediately when your mother came to hear me preach, and she saw the bond between you two. On the last night of the revival, she came to me in a panic. She and your father were not married, but he had never denied you, and he played an important role in your life. According to her, he was also a member of a very rich, powerful local family. When she learned she had inoperable cancer, he had stepped up and promised he would take you into the family, and he had informed them of his plans. The night she came to me, she was sobbing uncontrollably. Your father had been killed in a car accident early that morning, and already she had received a threat on your life. Aware that she had only weeks to live and no one else to whom she could turn, she begged me to take you and raise you with Maria. So I did. It was then that I began to understand I was being led down this path by a power greater than my own.<br><br>"Holly, you are my oldest, but you came to me last. You were born Harriet Mackey and were five when you and your mother showed up at a revival I was holding in St. Louis, Missouri. She seemed troubled, but I thought nothing of it. At one time or another, we are all troubled by something or someone. On the fourth and last night of the revival, I thought everyone was gone from the church. Maria and Savannah had gone to sleep in the pastor's office, and I was going to get them when your mother showed up at the door with you and a suitcase.<br><br></p><h2>The Borrowers Aloft: With the short tale Poor Stainless</h2><p>Imprisoned in an attic by a greedy couple who want to use them as performers, the Borrowers escape by balloon.<br></p><p>First published in 1961<br>Previous paperback edition 1990<br>0-15-210533-6<br><br><p>Mary Norton (1903-1992) lived in England, where she was an actress, playwright, and award-winning author of the classic Borrowers novels.</p><br>^No Bio^No Bio</p><h2>A Redbird Christmas: A Novel (Random House Large Print)</h2><p>With the same incomparable style and warm, inviting voice that have made her beloved by millions of readers far and wide, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Fannie Flagg has written an enchanting Christmas story of faith and hope for all ages that is sure to become a classic. <br>Deep in the southernmost part of Alabama, along the banks of a lazy winding river, lies the sleepy little community known as Lost River, a place that time itself seems to have forgotten.

Although poetic language is to be found in many Old Testament books, it is the predominant form in these ones. The book of Psalms and the Song of Songs (or Song of Solomon) contain lyric poetry, whereas the other books consist mainly of proverbs or aphorisms in verse form, and wisdom poems in varying lengths. This is primarily why the Psalms and the Song are described as poetical books, and the others as wisdom books. </p><p>This volume also contains notes, introductions, and Latin. The editors' notes, which are rarely very technical, are designed to elucidate the spiritual and theological message of the Bible.</p></p><p></p><h2>National Geographic Concise History of World Religions: An Illustrated Time Line</h2><p><i>The Concise History of World Religions</i> continues the Concise History series with an authoritative and comprehensive take on major religions and lesser-known faiths of all times and nations. No other text combines the illustrations expertise of National Geographic with the historical focus on faiths&#x2014;large and small&#x2014;across the world. Up-to-date scholarship offers a unique global perspective on the history of faith in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Oceania, and Africa and the Middle East. This is religion presented as history, in the objective manner in which the National Geographic Society excels. Lavish illustrations illuminate the faithful, their houses of worship, and the articles and artifacts of faith. From the great cathedrals to the colorful robes of Buddhist monks to horrors of the Spanish inquisition to the astonishingly intricate paintings of the Hindu gods, the illustrations tell as much of the story as the text.<br> &nbsp;<br> There is nothing else quite like National Geographic's special Concise History series: the time line format combines geography, chronology, and subject area in one complete, but easy-to-understand grid. The 80 timelines with their more than 3,500 entries, plus short articles and feature spreads make it the perfect quick-dip reference; 110 sidebars amplify the illustrated time lines and highlight monuments of faith, words of religious transcendence, and lives of piety and sacrifice; 50 feature essays explore in detail the origins, development and influence of faith; 325 images document all aspects of the religious experience, from architecture and icons to exemplary individuals and acts of devotion; and quotes throughout chapters are drawn from prayers and sermons that embody the religious attitudes of each era.<br> &nbsp;<br><i> The Concise History of World Religions</i> is a fantastic journey with National Geographic, following the rise and fall of faiths across centuries and around the world.

How did we get here and what is the purpose of our lives? Is there an agency that controls them? Almost as soon as our ancestors became conscious of being human, they began to attempt to influence events in the world around them through magic. Some 30,000 years ago a prehistoric artist painting animals on the walls of Chauvet Cave in France added a curious figure with the lower half of a human and the upper half of a buffalo. Archaeologists suggest that this &#x201c;sorcerer&#x201d; may have played some part in rituals intended to ensure the success of the hunt; they believe that the cave paintings themselves probably had a similar purpose. Clearly, the com- munity that created the Chauvet paintings&#x2014;the oldest-known cave paintings in the world&#x2014; believed in the existence of some kind of power that lay beyond the visible and the rational.<br> &nbsp;<br> Such a belief lies squarely at the base of all modern and ancient faiths. Religion goes beyond magic to propose the existence of deities that have a direct influence on the course of human lives, for better or for worse. Not only that: faith depends on the belief that human intervention can change the behavior of these gods or spirits through pro- pitiation&#x2014;the act of worship&#x2014;or through right belief and good conduct. Over time, the rituals of worship have become highly complex. Some involve making the gods happy with offerings and sacrifices; others with hymns and prayers; others by confessing and repenting sins.<br> &nbsp;<br> The precise nature of the first religions is lost in prehistory. From comparison with later &#x201c;unde-veloped&#x201d; faiths, however, they likely combined elements of magic with rites of supplication and invocation, possibly involving dancing and music. Such rituals were intended to help worshipers leave the confines of their own existence to come into contact with a more universal, supernatural level of being. Certain individuals who were felt to be particularly adept at communicating with the spirit world began to act as intermediaries between worshipers and their gods. Soon, these priests became the guardians of ritual and often the arbiters of acceptable and unac- ceptable behavior. The sites of worship, too, became more regular. Originally such sites were simply points in the landscape associated with the supernatural&#x2014;a hilltop, say, or a particularly majestic tree&#x2014;but increasingly buildings were constructed to house artifacts and images sacred to a deity or deities. As their design became more standardized, these temples became the focal points of worship; often they were the largest, most striking structures within a community.<br> &nbsp;<br> Meanwhile, people began to explain elements of the world that they could not understand by telling stories about the actions of gods and goddesses. These myths mutated as cultures came into contact and their religions evolved, but the stories reflected the environments from which they emerged and came to embody the core values and beliefs of a people. In India, where the oldest of today&#x2019;s religions emerged between 2500 and 1500 B.C., there were many gods. The three major Hindu gods&#x2014; Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva&#x2014;are all embodiments of aspects of the origin of every- thing: Brahman.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the Nile Valley, the myths of the ancient Egyptians told of animal-headed deities who controlled various aspects of life but whose equally important role was to preside over the afterlife. For the Greeks, the gods who lived high on Mount Olympus resem- bled their own aristocratic rulers, who were patrician, flush with power and given to self-indulgence, feuding, deception, and petty jealousies. The Romans inherited gods not only from the Greeks but also from the outer reaches of their empire, including esoteric cults from the east.<br> Among the cults of the east were the beliefs of the peoples who lived in what would become known as the Holy Land. There, among the Judaeans, prophets preached the special bond that their rulers had made with the almighty: an exalted status as chosen people in return for acknowledgment of the one true God. This monotheistic faith&#x2014;Judaism&#x2014;combined belief with politics, a combination that has remained popular. Around the start of the millennium Juda- ism would produce another religion dedicated to only one God, but this faith appealed also to non- Jews: Christianity.<br> &nbsp;<br> Meanwhile India had also given birth to another religion that would endure for many centuries; this time one without gods. The teachings of Siddhartha Gautama provided individuals with a set of moral guidelines by which to live and a goal that was not union with a supernatural deity but a state of being beyond happiness or suffering, known as nirvana. The faith later developed the idea of bodhisattvas, semidivine figures who helped believers accomplish their own nirvana.<br> Like Hinduism, Buddhism incorporated the idea of reincarnation: individuals were reborn as higher or lower beings (even as animals), depending on their conduct during their previous incarnation, until the soul achieved a final escape. In the west, meanwhile, religions took their cue from the religions of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, arguing that death was the start of an afterlife in which the soul would receive either divine rewards in return for a good life or punishment for not following the path of right conduct.</p><h2>Drop-Dead Easy Knits</h2><p>Finally, a knitting book featuring fantastic projects that don't require you to study a pattern for hours--a sure recipe for blissful, carefree knitting.

Working against tendencies to oversimplify hard core&#x2014;either as pure abusive power or pure liberatory pleasure&#x2014;Williams sees the form as inherently contradictory. Hard core claims to speak confessional and involuntary "truths" of sex. However, analysis of its forms (including its spectacular "money shots" and sexual "numbers" parallel to those in musicals) reveals that sex in the sense of a natural, visible "doing what comes naturally" is in fact the supreme and deeply contradictory fiction of the genre. Gender, the social construction of the relation between the sexes, is what determines this fiction.<br><br>For most of its history, pornography has been for men and about women. Yet in hard core's attempt to solve the riddles of sex with more, different, or better sex, the monolith of masculine pleasure breaks down and the possibility of women using pornography for their own purposes begins to emerge. To this end, Williams traces the roots of contemporary hard core's quest to see the "truth" of sex back to the origins of cinema itself&#x2014;in motion studies of women's bodily movements. She then follows the generic development of hard core through its silent, primitive stag form and into feature-length narratives like <i>Deep Throat</i> and <i>Behind the Green Door</i>, up to its recent sadomasochistic and "couples market" permutations&#x2014;showing how the form has begun to respond and react to changing gender relations. Neither a defense of what pornography has been nor a utopian dream of what it should be, this daring book refuses simply to scapegoat the form as the cause of all our ills. Instead, Williams utilizes the insights of recent studies of mass culture to show that hard core is a discourse, a genre, and a rhetoric that can only be understood through comparison with, rather than separation from, other forms.</p><p><b>Linda Williams</b> is the author of <i>Figures of Desire: A Theory and Analysis of Surrealist Film</i> and co-editor of <i>Re-Vision: Essays in Feminist Film Criticism.</i> She is Professor of Film Studies at the University of California, Irvine.In academic prose, film professor Williams of the University of California offers a graphic analysis of hard-core porno movies such as Deep Throat , as well as early, anonymous stag flicks. She finds that the newer, "softer" X-rated rental videos "show a more genuinely adult quality" than earlier videos. She ponders the "utopian problem-solving intent" of the hard-core genre and makes specious comparisons between blue movies, Hollywood musicals and films like Dirty Dancing . Sadomasochistic porn films, she claims, let viewers experience "a clearer confrontation with the oscillating poles of our gendered identities and the role of power in them." A critic whose professed goal is to understand film pornography, and who opposes those who would censor it, Williams begins this obfuscating study by analyzing the portrayal of women in the 19th-century kinetoscope, prototype of the motion-picture projector. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Moon Knight 1: From the Dead Marvel Now</h2><p>Marc Spector is Moon Knight!

He had spent Friday night in South Beach, Miami, in a salsa club, with a dancer from a cruise ship. The boat was Norwegian, and so was the girl. Reacher guessed she was too tall for ballet, but she was the right size for everything else. They met on the beach in the afternoon. Reacher was working on his tan. He felt better brown. He didn&#x2019;t know what she was working on. But he felt her shadow fall across his face and opened his eyes to find her staring at him. Or maybe at his scars. The browner he got, the more they stood out, white and wicked and obvious. She was pale, in a black bikini. A <i>small </i>black bikini. He pegged her for a dancer long before she told him. It was in the way she held herself. <br><br>They ended up having a late dinner together and then going out to the club. South Beach salsa wouldn&#x2019;t have been Reacher&#x2019;s first choice, but her company made it worthwhile. She was fun to be with. And she was a great dancer, obviously. Full of energy. She wore him out. At four in the morning she took him back to her hotel, eager to wear him out some more. Her hotel was a small Art Deco place near the ocean. Clearly the cruise line treated its people well. Certainly it was a much more romantic destination than Reacher&#x2019;s own motel. And much closer. <br><br>And it had cable television, which Reacher&#x2019;s place didn&#x2019;t. He woke at eight on Saturday morning when he heard the dancer in the shower. He turned on the TV and went looking for ESPN. He wanted Friday night&#x2019;s American League highlights. He never found them. He clicked his way through successive channels and then stopped dead on CNN because he heard the chief of an Indiana police department say a name he knew: <i>James Barr. </i>The picture was of a press conference. Small room, harsh light. Top of the screen was a caption that said: <i>Courtesy NBC. </i>There was a banner across the bottom that said: <i>Friday Night Massacre. </i>The police chief said the name again, <i>James Barr, </i>and then he introduced a homicide detective called Emerson. Emerson looked tired. Emerson said the name for a third time: <i>James Barr. </i>Then, like he anticipated the exact question in Reacher&#x2019;s mind, he ran through a brief biography: <i>Forty-one years old, local Indiana resident, U.S. Army infantry specialist from 1985 to 1991, Gulf War veteran, never married, currently unemployed.<br></i><br>Reacher watched the screen. Emerson seemed like a concise type of a guy. He was brief. No bullshit. He finished his statement and in response to a reporter&#x2019;s question declined to specify what if anything James Barr had said during interrogation. Then he introduced a District Attorney. This guy&#x2019;s name was Rodin, and he wasn&#x2019;t concise. Wasn&#x2019;t brief. He used plenty of bullshit. He spent ten minutes claiming Emerson&#x2019;s credit for himself. Reacher knew how <i>that </i>worked. He had been a cop of sorts for thirteen years. Cops bust their tails, and prosecutors bask in the glory. Rodin said <i>James Barr </i>a few more times and then said the state was maybe looking to fry him.<br><br>For what?<br><br>Reacher waited.<br><br>A local anchor called Ann Yanni came on. She recapped the events of the night before. Sniper slaying. Senseless slaughter. An automatic weapon. A parking garage. A public plaza. Commuters on their way home after a long workweek. Five dead. A suspect in custody, but a city still grieving.<br><br>Reacher thought it was Yanni who was grieving. Emerson&#x2019;s success had cut her story short. She signed off and CNN went to political news. Reacher turned the TV off. The dancer came out of the bathroom. She was pink and fragrant. And naked. She had left her towels inside.<br><br>&#x201c;What shall we do today?&#x201d; she said, with a wide Norwegian smile.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to Indiana,&#x201d; Reacher said.<br>He walked north in the heat to the Miami bus depot. Then he leafed through a greasy timetable and planned a route. It wasn&#x2019;t going to be an easy trip. Miami to Jacksonville would be the first leg. Then Jacksonville to New Orleans. Then New Orleans to St. Louis. Then St. Louis to Indianapolis. Then a local bus, presumably, south into the heartland. Five separate destinations. Arrival and departure times were not well integrated. Beginning to end, it was going to take more than forty-eight hours. He was tempted to fly or rent a car, but he was short of money and he liked buses better and he figured nothing much was going to happen on the weekend anyway.<br><br>What happened on the weekend was that Rosemary Barr called her firm&#x2019;s investigator back. She figured Franklin would have a semiindependent point of view. She got him at home, ten o&#x2019;clock in the morning on the Sunday.<br><br>&#x201c;I think I should hire different lawyers,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Franklin said nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;David Chapman thinks he&#x2019;s guilty,&#x201d; Rosemary said. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t he?<br>So he&#x2019;s already given up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t comment,&#x201d; Franklin said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s one of my employers.&#x201d;<br><br>Now Rosemary Barr said nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;How was the hospital?&#x201d; Franklin asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Awful. He&#x2019;s in intensive care with a bunch of prison deadbeats. They&#x2019;ve got him handcuffed to the bed. He&#x2019;s in a <i>coma, </i>for God&#x2019;s sake. How do they think he&#x2019;s going to escape?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the legal position?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He was arrested but not arraigned. He&#x2019;s in a kind of limbo.<br><br>They&#x2019;re assuming he wouldn&#x2019;t have gotten bail.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re probably right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So they claim under the circumstances it&#x2019;s like he actually <i>didn&#x2019;t </i>get bail. So he&#x2019;s <i>theirs. </i>He&#x2019;s in the system. Like a twilight zone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What would you like to happen?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He shouldn&#x2019;t be in handcuffs. And he should be in a VA hospital at least. But that won&#x2019;t happen until I find a lawyer who&#x2019;s prepared to help him.&#x201d;<br><br>Franklin paused. &#x201c;How do you explain all the evidence?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know my brother.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You moved out, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For other reasons. Not because he&#x2019;s a homicidal maniac.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He blocked off a parking space,&#x201d; Franklin said. &#x201c;He premeditated this thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You think he&#x2019;s guilty, too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I work with what I&#x2019;ve got. And what I&#x2019;ve got doesn&#x2019;t look good.&#x201d;<br><br>Rosemary Barr said nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Franklin said.<br><br>&#x201c;Can you recommend another lawyer?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can you make that decision? Do you have a power of attorney?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s implied. He&#x2019;s in a coma. I&#x2019;m his next of kin.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How much money have you got?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not much.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How much has <i>he </i>got?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s some equity in his house.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It won&#x2019;t look good. It&#x2019;ll be like a kick in the teeth for the firm you work for.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t worry about that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You could lose everything, including your job.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll lose it anyway, unless I help James. If he&#x2019;s convicted, they&#x2019;ll let me go. I&#x2019;ll be notorious. By association. An embarrassment.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He had your sleeping pills,&#x201d; Franklin said.<br><br>&#x201c;I gave them to him. He doesn&#x2019;t have insurance.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why did he need them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He has trouble sleeping.&#x201d;<br><br>Franklin said nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;You think he&#x2019;s guilty,&#x201d; Rosemary said.<br><br>&#x201c;The evidence is overwhelming,&#x201d; Franklin said.<br><br>&#x201c;David Chapman isn&#x2019;t really trying, is he?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have to consider the possibility that David Chapman is right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who should I call?&#x201d;<br><br>Franklin paused.<br><br>&#x201c;Try Helen Rodin,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Rodin?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s the DA&#x2019;s daughter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s downtown.

She&#x2019;s new and she&#x2019;s keen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is it ethical?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No law against it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It would be father against daughter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was going to be Chapman, and Chapman knows Rodin a lot better than his daughter does, probably. She&#x2019;s been away for a long time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;College, law school, clerking for a judge in D.C.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is she any good?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think she&#x2019;s going to be.&#x201d;<br>Rosemary Barr called Helen Rodin on her office number. It was like a test. Someone new and keen should be at the office on a Sunday.<br><br>Helen Rodin was at the office on a Sunday. She answered the call sitting at her desk. Her desk was secondhand and it sat proudly in a mostly empty two-room suite in the same black glass tower that had NBC as the second-floor tenant. The suite was rented cheap through one of the business subsidies that the city was throwing around like confetti. The idea was to kick-start the rejuvenated downtown area and clean up later with healthy tax revenues.<br><br>Rosemary Barr didn&#x2019;t have to tell Helen Rodin about the case because the whole thing had happened right outside Helen Rodin&#x2019;s new office window. Helen had seen some of it for herself, and she had followed the rest on the news afterward. She had caught all of Ann Yanni&#x2019;s TV appearances. She recognized her from the building&#x2019;s lobby, and the elevator.<br><br>&#x201c;Will you help my brother?&#x201d; Rosemary Barr asked.<br><br>Helen Rodin paused. The smart answer would be <i>No way. </i>She knew that. Like <i>No way, forget about it, are you out of your mind? </i>Two reasons. One, she knew a major clash with her father was inevitable at some point, but did she need it <i>now</i>? And two, she knew that a new lawyer&#x2019;s early cases defined her. Paths were taken that led down fixed routes. To end up as a when-all-else-fails criminal-defense attorney would be OK, she guessed, all things considered. But to start out by taking a case that had offended the whole city would be a marketing disaster. The shootings weren&#x2019;t being seen as a <i>crime. </i>They were being seen as an <i>atrocity. </i>Against humanity, against the whole community, against the rejuvenation efforts downtown, against the whole idea of being from Indiana. It was like LA or New York or Baltimore had come to the heartland, and to be the person who tried to excuse it or explain it away would be a fatal mistake. Like a mark of Cain. It would follow her the rest of her life.<br><br>&#x201c;Can we sue the jail?&#x201d; Rosemary Barr asked. &#x201c;For letting him get hurt?&#x201d;<br><br>Helen Rodin paused again. Another good reason to say no. <i>An unrealistic client.<br></i><br>&#x201c;Maybe later,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Right now he wouldn&#x2019;t generate much sympathy as a plaintiff. And it&#x2019;s hard to prove damages, if he&#x2019;s heading for death row anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then I can&#x2019;t pay you much,&#x201d; Rosemary Barr said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have money.&#x201d;<br><br>Helen Rodin paused for a third time. <i>Another </i>good reason to say no. It was a little early in her career to be contemplating pro bono work.<br>But. But. But.<br><br>The accused deserved representation. The Bill of Rights said so. And he was innocent until proven guilty. And if the evidence was as bad as her father said it was, then the whole thing would be little more than a supervisory process. She would verify the case against him independently. Then she would advise him to plead guilty. Then she would watch his back as her father fed him through the machine. That was all. It could be seen as honest dues-paying. A constitutional chore. She hoped.<br><br>&#x201c;OK,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s innocent,&#x201d; Rosemary Barr said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure of it.&#x201d;<br><i><br>They always are, </i>Helen Rodin thought.<br><br>&#x201c;OK,&#x201d; she said again. Then she told her new client to meet her in her office at seven the next morning. It was like a test. A sister who really believed in her brother&#x2019;s innocence would show up for an early appointment.<br>Rosemary Barr showed up right on time, at seven o&#x2019;clock on Monday morning. Franklin was there, too. He believed in Helen Rodin and was prepared to defer his bills until he saw which way the wind was blowing. Helen Rodin herself had already been at her desk for an hour. She had informed David Chapman of the change in representation on Sunday afternoon and had obtained the audiotape of his initial interview with James Barr. Chapman had been happy to hand it over and wash his hands. She had played the tape to herself a dozen times Sunday night and a dozen more that morning. It was all anyone had of James Barr. Maybe all anyone was ever going to get. So she had listened to it carefully, and she had drawn some early conclusions from it.<br><br>&#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>She had the tape cued up and ready in an old-fashioned machine the size of a shoe box. She pressed <i>Play </i>and they all heard a hiss and breathing and room sounds and then David Chapman&#x2019;s voice: <i>I can&#x2019;t help you if you won&#x2019;t help yourself. </i>There was a long pause, full of more hiss, and then James Barr spoke: <i>They got the wrong guy. . . . They got the wrong guy, </i>he said again. Then Helen watched the tape counter numbers and spooled forward to Chapman saying: <i>Denying it is not an option. </i>Then Barr&#x2019;s voice came through: <i>Get Jack Reacher for me. </i>Helen spooled onward to Chapman&#x2019;s question: <i>Is he a doctor? </i>Then there was nothing on the tape except the sound of Barr beating on the interview room door.<br><br>&#x201c;OK,&#x201d; Helen said. &#x201c;I think he really believes he didn&#x2019;t do it. He claims as much, and then he gets frustrated and terminates the interview when Chapman doesn&#x2019;t take him seriously. That&#x2019;s clear, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He <i>didn&#x2019;t </i>do it,&#x201d; Rosemary Barr said.<br><br>&#x201c;I spoke with my father yesterday,&#x201d; Helen Rodin said. &#x201c;The evidence is all there, Ms. Barr. He did it, I&#x2019;m afraid. You need to accept that a sister maybe can&#x2019;t know her brother as well as she&#x2019;d like. Or if she once did, that he changed for some reason.&#x201d;<br><br>There was a long silence.<br><br>&#x201c;Is your father telling you the truth about the evidence?&#x201d; Rosemary asked.<br><br>&#x201c;He has to,&#x201d; Helen said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to see it all anyway. There&#x2019;s the discovery process. We&#x2019;re going to take depositions. There would be no sense in him bluffing at this point.&#x201d;<br><br>Nobody spoke.<br><br>&#x201c;But we can still help your brother,&#x201d; Helen said in the silence. &#x201c;He believes he didn&#x2019;t do it. I&#x2019;m sure of that, after listening to the tape.<br>Therefore he&#x2019;s delusional now. Or at least he was on Saturday.<br>Therefore perhaps he was delusional on Friday, too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How does that help him?&#x201d; Rosemary Barr asked. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s still admitting he did it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The consequences will be different. If he recovers. Time and treatment in an institution will be a lot better than time and <i>no </i>treatment in a maximum security prison.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You want to have James declared insane?&#x201d;<br><br>Helen nodded. &#x201c;A medical defense is our best shot. And if we establish it right now, it might improve the way they handle him before the trial.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He might die. That&#x2019;s what the doctors said. I don&#x2019;t want him to die a criminal. I want to clear his name.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He hasn&#x2019;t been tried yet. He hasn&#x2019;t been convicted. He&#x2019;s still an innocent man in the eyes of the law.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not the same.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Helen said. &#x201c;I guess it isn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>There was another long silence.<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s meet back here at ten-thirty,&#x201d; Helen said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll thrash out a strategy. If we&#x2019;re aiming for a change of hospitals, we should try for it sooner rather than later.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We need to find this Jack Reacher person,&#x201d; Rosemary Barr said.<br><br>Helen nodded. &#x201c;I gave his name to Emerson and my father.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because Emerson&#x2019;s people cleared your brother&#x2019;s house out.<br>They might have found an address or a phone number. And my father needed to know because we want this guy on our witness list, not the prosecution&#x2019;s. Because he might be able to help us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He might be an alibi.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe an old army buddy, at best.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see how,&#x201d; Franklin said. &#x201c;They were different ranks and different branches.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We need to find him,&#x201d; Rosemary Barr said. &#x201c;James asked for him, didn&#x2019;t he? That has to mean something.&#x201d;<br><br>Helen nodded again. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d certainly like to find him. He might have something for us. Some exculpatory information, possibly. Or at least he might be a link to something we can use...</p><h2>Setting The Scene: The Art &amp; Evolution of Animation Layout</h2><p>The first of its kind, this comprehensive look at the art of &#39;Animation Layout&#39; takes readers on a tour through this essential and beautiful, but often forgotten, art form, from animation&#39;s earliest pioneers through to the digital world of video games and contemporary cinema.

Armies of young enthusiastic mosquitoes rose from woodland bogs and deployed about the county, harassing tourists. Permanent residents were never bothered. And, after a while, even newcomers developed an immunity, attributed to minerals in the drinking water and in the soil that grew such flavorful potatoes. As for the summer people, they bought quantities of insect repellent and went on praising the perfect weather, the wonderful fishing, and the ravishing natural beauty of Moose County.</p><p>One morning in mid-June a columnist for the <i>Moose County Something</i> was working against deadline, writing his annual thousand-word salute to Skeeter Week. With tongue in cheek he reported readers' exaggerated claims: A farmer in Wildcat had trained a corps of skeeters to buzz him awake every morning in time for milking. A music teacher in Pickax City had a pet skeeter that buzzed Mendelssohn's "Spinning Song."</p><p>He was no backwoods journalist. He was James Mackintosh Qwilleran, former crime writer for major newspapers Down Below, as the locals called all states except Alaska. A freak inheritance had brought him north to Pickax, the county seat (population 3,000). It also made him the richest man in the northeast central United States. (It was a long story.)</p><p>He cut a striking figure as he went about, interviewing and making friends for the paper. He was fiftyish, tall, well built, with an enviable head of graying hair and a pepper-and-salt moustache of magnificent proportions. But there was more to the man than an instantly recognizable moustache; he had brooding eyes and a sympathetic mien and a willingness to listen that encouraged confidences. Yet, his friends, readers, and fellow citizens had come to realize that the sober aspect masked a genial personality and sense of humor. And everyone knew that he lived alone in a converted apple barn, with two Siamese cats.</p><p>Qwilleran wrote his column, "Straight from the Qwill Pen," on an old electric typewriter at the barn, closely supervised by his male cat. As he ripped the last page out of the machine, Kao K'o Kung, with an internal growl, let him know the phone was going to ring.</p><p>It rang, and a familiar woman's voice said anxiously, "Sorry to bother you, Qwill."</p><p>"No bother. I've just finished-"</p><p>"I need to talk to you privately," she interrupted, "while my husband is out of town."</p><p>Qwilleran had a healthy curiosity and a journalist's taste for intrigue. "Where's he gone?"</p><p>"To Bixby, for plumbing fixtures. It may be foolish of me, but-"</p><p>"Don't worry. I'll be there in a half hour."</p><p>"Come to the cottage in the rear."</p><p>Lori and Nick Bamba were the young couple who had come to his rescue when he was a greenhorn from Down Below getting bitten by mosquitoes. She was a small-town postmaster then; he was chief engineer at the state prison. They had two ambitions: to raise a family and to be innkeepers.</p><p>When Qwilleran had an opportunity to recommend them for the new Nutcracker Inn located in Black Creek, he was happy to do so. In a way, he felt like the godfather of the Nutcracker. If he had not been the sole heir of Aunt Fanny Klingenschoen (who was not even related to him)...And if he had not been totally overwhelmed by the size of the bequest (billions) and the responsibility it entailed...And if he had not established the Klingenschoen Foundation to use the money for the good of the community...And if the K Fund had not purchased the old Limburger mansion to refurbish as a country inn...</p><p>Such were his ruminations as he drove the miles to Black Creek, a virtual ghost town until the Nutcracker Inn brought it back to life. The renovation had won national publicity; some well-known names had appeared on the guest register; new shops were opening in the quaint little downtown.</p><p>Qwilleran had seen the Victorian house when the last eccentric Limburger was alive. A section of the ornamental iron fence had been sold to a passing stranger; a broken window was a Halloween trick when the old man refused to treat; bricks from the crumbling steps were used to throw at stray dogs. In Qwilleran's opinion, the only upbeat feature was a cuckoo clock in the front hall, its crazy bird popping out and announcing the time with monotonous cheer.</p><p>Now, approaching Black Creek, he planned his strategy. In Moose County, where everyone knew the make and model of everyone's vehicle, his own five-year-old brown van was especially conspicuous. It would hardly do to be seen calling on the innkeeper's wife while the innkeeper was in Bixby buying plumbing supplies. So the brown van was parked in the main lot of the inn with the luncheon guests, after which the driver ambled about the grounds feeding the squirrels. Not having any peanuts, he had brought cocktail nuts, and the squirrels showed no objection to pecans and cashews, slightly salted.</p><p>The Lori Bamba who admitted him to the cottage was not the sunny personality he had known. The golden braids coiled around her head seemed drab, and her eyes were not as blue. She offered him coffee and a black walnut cookie, and he accepted.</p><p>"How are the Bambas' brilliant brats?" he asked to add a light touch.</p><p>"The boys are in summer camp, and Lovey is with her grandma in Mooseville. We get together Sundays."</p><p>"That's good. So what is the serious matter on your mind?"</p><p>"Well...I always thought innkeeping would be my kind of work: meeting people, making them happy, providing a holiday atmosphere. Instead I feel gloomy."</p><p>"Is your health okay?'</p><p>"At my last physical my doctor said I'd live to be a hundred and ten." She said it without a smile. "The funny thing is-when I go to Mooseville on Sundays or into Pickax on errands, I feel normal. I think there's something depressing about the building itself! I've always been sensitive to my environment, and I believe the theory that old houses absorb the personality of those who've lived there."</p><p>He nodded. "I've heard that!" He avoided saying whether he believed it.</p><p>"Nick says I'm being silly. He says it's all in my head. It's a grand old building, and the redecorating is fabulous, but I feel a dark cloud hanging over the premises."</p><p>What could he say? He thought of the Dunfield house at the beach, where a man had been murdered. Realty agents could neither rent nor sell it, although its unsavory past had been suppressed. He said, "I wish there were something I could do. I'd be willing to spend a few days here-to see if I pick up any adverse vibrations."</p><p>"Would you, Qwill?" she cried. "You could have a suite on the top floor and bring the cats. You'd be our guest!"</p><p>"No, no! The story would be that I'm researching material for my column. All charges would go on my expense account. What meals are available?"</p><p>"Breakfast and dinner. We have an excellent chef-from Palm Springs. Also, the suites have a small refrigerator and a coffee maker. Would you like to see one of them?"</p><p>"Won't be necessary. I had the grand tour when the inn opened last fall. Is the black cat still here?"</p><p>"Nicodemus? Oh, yes! The guests love him; he's so sweet in spite of his wicked eyes!" He was sleek and black with the most unusual eyes; they were triangular and had a stare like a laser beam. "He's our rodent control officer," Lori said with some of her old enthusiasm. "He doesn't catch mice; he just terrifies them. Do you like canoeing, Qwill? We have a few canoes available down at the creek."</p><p>In his younger days Qwilleran had often thought, If I can't play second base for the Chicago Cubs, or write for <i>The New York Times</i>, or act on the Broadway stage...I'd like to be an investigator. And now even so nebulous a mystery as Lori's "dark cloud" piqued his curiosity. Furthermore...</p><p>Qwilleran relished a frequent change of address. His early experience as a globetrotting correspondent had given him a chronic case of wanderlust. The Black Creek venture would be timely; the chief woman in his life was leaving on vacation. Polly Duncan, director of the Pickax public library, planned to tour museum villages on the East Coast in the company of her sister, who lived in Cincinnati. Qwilleran wondered about these sisterly flings. In Canada the previous year they had met a highly personable Quebec professor, and he had been corresponding with Polly ever since...in French! She said it helped her brush up on her idioms.</p><p>Qwilleran would drive her to the airport in the morning, but tonight there would be a farewell dinner in the Mackintosh Room at the hotel.</p><p>As soon as they were seated, he asked the usual fatuous questions. "Are you all packed? Are you excited?"</p><p>"I hate to leave Brutus and Catta, but there's a cat-sitter in the neighborhood who'll come in twice a day to give them food and attention. This morning I wrote a limerick about Catta while I was showering: A female feline named Catta/is getting fatta and fatta/but she's pretty and purry/and funny and furry/so what does an ounce or two matta?"</p><p>"I couldn't have done 'betta' myself," he said, with apologies. "If we announce another limerick contest this summer, will you be one of the judges?"</p><p>"I'd love to! Meanwhile, what are you going to do while I'm away?"</p><p>"Read trashy novels and give wild parties, if I can find anyone who likes wild parties....But seriously, I plan to spend a couple of weeks at the Nutcracker Inn in search of new material for my column."</p><p>"I wish you were coming with me, Qwill."</p><p>"Maybe next year, but no museums! I get all the education I want on the 'Qwill Pen' beat."</p><p>"We could go to the Italian hill country and read poetry, far from the madding crowd."</p><p>"The madding crowd is everywhere these days, Polly-taking snapshots and buying postcards. And by the way, when you send me postcards, bear in mind that the picture on the front is less important than the message on the back! More news! More news!"</p><p>His own words would ring in his ears for the next two weeks; Polly always cooperated with zeal.</p><p>But first Qwilleran had to get her to the airport for the 8:00 A.M. shuttle flight to Minneapolis. After tearful good-byes to Brutus and Catta and a race to the airport, the flight was delayed because the pilot of the shuttle had not arrived. According to the airport manager, the pilot's baby-sitter was ill, and she was having difficulty finding a substitute. Eventually she arrived and passengers were reassured that they would make their connections.</p><p>When the plane finally taxied to the runway, lifted off and disappeared into the sky, the groundlings watched it go, as if witnesses to a miracle.</p><p>On the way home Qwilleran pulled off the highway to make some phone calls. Moose County was the first in the state to prohibit use of a cell phone while operating a vehicle.

She sits on the boards of many prestigious peer reviewed journals and is the recipient of numerous honors and awards. Read Brizendine's guest review of <em>The Genius In All of Us</em>:</strong> <br> <p> </p> <p>In <i>The Genius in All of Us</i> Shenk beautifully explains why the nature-nurture debate is dead. It is not just the genes we are born with, but how we are raised and what opportunities are open to us that determine how smart we will become. Nurture and experience reshape our genes, and thus our brain. Shenk argues that the idea we are either born with genius or talent, or we aren&#x2019;t, is simply untrue. The notion that relentless, deliberate practice changes the brain and thus our abilities has been undervalued over the past 30 years in favor of the concept of &#x201c;innate giftedness.&#x201d; Practice, practice, practice (some say 10,000 hours or more) is what it takes. Shenk argues that it is just some fantasy that effortless, gifted genius is born and not made. He marshals evidence to show that genetic factors do not trump environmental factors but rather work in concert with them. Shenk notes that by the sweat of our brow we can train ourselves to be successful--even if we are born with only average genetic talent. Scientists know that how we are raised and how we are trained affects the expression of our genes. If you think you&#x2019;ve reached your talent limit, think again, Shenk says. It&#x2019;s not just in your genes, he says, but in the intensity of your motivation. Ambition, persistence, and self-discipline are not just products of genes, but can be shaped by nurture and environment. Certainly it is important to have good genes, but that determines at most only 50 percent of your talent. He underscores the point that intelligence is made up of the skills that a person has developed--with an emphasis on &#x201c;developed&#x201d;--through hard work. Encouraging ourselves and our children to work hard requires being surrounded by others also wanting to achieve striving for excellence. Moreover, Shenk gives the hopeful message not just for kids, but also for adults. Happily for us, the human brain remains plastic, changeable and trainable well into old age. So no matter how old you are, if you&#x2019;d like to be smarter--get to work! <em>--Louann Brizendine</em></p> <strong>A Q&amp;A with David Shenk</strong> <br> <p> </p> <b>Question:</b> Your book is called <i>The Genius in All of Us: Why Everything You&#x2019;ve Been Told About Genetics, Talent, and IQ is Wrong</i>. That&#x2019;s a big claim. Everything and how so?<p></p> <p><b>David Shenk:</b> It is a bold statement, and it reflects how poorly the public has been served when it comes to understanding the relationship between biology and ability. The clich�s we&#x2019;ve been taught about genetic blueprints, IQ, and "giftedness" all come out of crude, early-20th century guesswork. The reality is so much more interesting and complex. Genes do have a powerful influence on everything we do, but they respond to their environments in all sorts of interesting ways. We&#x2019;ve now learned a lot more about the developmental mechanisms that enable people to get really good at stuff. Intelligence and talent turn out to be about process, not about whether you were born with certain "gifts."</p> <p><b>Question:</b> In <i>The Genius in All of Us</i> you state that the concept of nature versus nurture is over. Scientists, cognitive psychologists, and geneticists are moving towards an idea of &#x2018;interactionism.' What does this mean? If the battle of genes versus environment is over, who has won? Which is more important?</p> <p><b>David Shenk:</b> They both won, because they're both vitally important. But the new science shows us that they do not act separately. Declaring that a person gets X-percent of his/her intelligence from genes and Y-percent from the environment is like saying that X-percent of Shakespeare's greatness can be found in his verbs, and Y-percent in his adjectives. There is no nature vs. nurture, or nature plus nurture; instead, it's nature interacting with nurture, which is often expressed by scientists as "GxE" (genes times intelligence). This is what "interactionism" refers to. A vanguard of geneticists, neuroscientists, and psychologists have stepped forward in recent years to articulate the importance of the dynamic interaction between genes and the environment.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> You describe genes and environment as a sound board. How so?</p> <p><b>David Shenk:</b> In the past, we&#x2019;ve been taught that each distinct gene contains a certain dossier of information, which in turn determines a certain trait; if you have the blue-eyed gene, you get blue eyes. Period.</p> <p>It turns out, though, that the information contained inside genes is only part of the story; another critical part is how often genes get "expressed," or turned on, by other genes and by outside forces. It&#x2019;s therefore helpful to think of your genome as a giant mixing board with thousands of knobs and switches. Genes are always getting turned on/off/up/down by hormones, nutrients, etc. People actually affect their own genome&#x2019;s behavior with their actions. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> How do these new findings affect the concept of the "The Bell Curve"--that we live in an increasingly stratified world where the "cognitive elite," those with the best genes, are more and more isolated from the cognitive/genetic underclass? Is that idea now completely obsolete? </p> <p><b>David Shenk:</b> Yes, it is obsolete. The idea that there is a genetic super-class that has a corner on high-IQ genes is nonsense. This comes out of a profound misunderstanding of how genes work and how intelligence works, and also from a misreading of so-called "heritability" studies. I am not saying that genes don&#x2019;t affect intelligence. Genes affect everything. But by and large I think the evidence shows that people with low intelligence are missing out on key developmental advantages.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> Lewis Terman invented the IQ test at Stanford University in 1916. He declared it the ideal tool to determine a person&#x2019;s native intelligence. Are IQ tests accurate? What are the benefits and fallout of the IQ test?</p> <p><b>David Shenk:</b> IQ tests accurately rank academic achievement. That&#x2019;s quite different from identifying innate intelligence, which doesn&#x2019;t really exist. Tufts intelligence expert Robert Sternberg explains that "intelligence represents a set of competencies in development." In other words, intelligence isn&#x2019;t fixed. Intelligence isn&#x2019;t general. Intelligence is not a thing. Instead, intelligence is a dynamic, diffuse, and ongoing process.</p> <p>The IQ test has valid uses. It can help teachers and principals understand how well students are doing and what they&#x2019;re missing. But the widespread belief that it defines what each of us are capable of (and limited to) is disabling for individuals and society. People simply cannot reach their full potential if they honestly believe that they are so severely restricted. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> How do we go about finding the genius in all of us? What steps we can take to unlock latent talent?</p> <p><b>David Shenk:</b> Find the thing you love to do, and work and work and work at it. Don't be discouraged by failure; realize that high achievers thrive on failure as a motivating mechanism and as instruction guide on how to get better. </p> <p>(Photo � Alexandra Beers)</p>DAVID SHENK is the national bestselling author of five previous books, including&nbsp;<i>The Forgetting, Data Smog,</i>&nbsp;and most recently, <i>The Immortal Game.</i> He is a correspondent for&nbsp;TheAtlantic.com, and has contributed to&nbsp;<i>National Geographic, Slate, The New York Times, Gourmet, Harper&#x2019;s, The New Yorker,&nbsp;</i>NPR, and PBS.</p><h2>Complete Herbal Book for the Dog</h2><p>The first half of the book deals with diet, feeding, care of the in-whelp bitch and natural rearing of puppies.

The secret process which produced them combines the delicacy of watercolors with the look and feel of modern color photographs. The pictures are largely the work of the legendary William Henry Jackson, the pioneer photographer who explored the frontiers of the old American west with huge wet-plate cameras and a portable darktent strapped to the back of his trusty mule.<br>Jackson's name is synonymous with high adventure, and Jim Hughes' richly detailed introduction tells a gripping story. Jackson was born in 1843 in New York, and by the 1860s he was on his first trip west, working as a bullwhacker on a wagon train when the nation's unfinished rail lines would take him no further. Finally, on the edge of the western frontier, he began photographing the wild and often spectacularly beautiful landscape of a wilderness soon to be forced into submission by the advancing railroads.<br>Over the next three decades Jackson became the most celebrated of a small and hardy band of pioneer photographers, creating a striking photographic record of the rapidly changing face of America. When his photographs of Yellowstone were credited with helping to persuade Congress to make the region the first National Park, his place in history was secure. From the Rockies to California, from the Great Lakes to the deep South, from teeming New York City to forested New Hampshire these photographs capture both urban and rural landscapes to provide a unique picture of the social and physical evolution of the United States. The book is arranged as a visual tour of the country, and is written with fascinating insights into America's places and politics at the turn of the century.<br>In 1897 Jackson sold the bulk of his enormous archive of photographs to the Detroit Photographic Company, which he joined as a partner. The firm had recently licensed Photochrom, a secret Swiss process for turning black-and-white photographs into color. Completely distinct from today's four-color reproduction, Photochrom is a continuous-tone color rendition of a black-and-white photograph that uses multiple impressions from lithographic stones. The color produced was astonishingly naturalistic, and it was to this process that Jackson devoted his final years of active photography. Gone now was the mule, as he traveled North America in a specially equipped railroad car in search of images to tell the story of the closing of one epoch and the dawning of another.<br>William Henry Jackson died in 1942 after a lifetime that spanned almost the entire history of photography. In recent years, thousands of never distributed Photochrom prints were discovered in a Montana warehouse. This book offers an ample selection of the finest, all published for the first time.</p><p>One of America's most notable early photographers, Jackson (1843-1942) counts among his many credits dramatic photographs of Yellowstone that helped convince Congress to purchase it as the first U.S. national park. Unknown to historians was this cache of undistributed chromolithographs, the result of Jackson's collaboration with the Detroit Photographic Company. His black-and-white negatives, featuring urban, rural, and wilderness scenes taken throughout the United States and in parts of Canada, underwent a time-consuming process called Photochrom that resulted in richly colored images. All the images have an idealized "postcard" quality, and many were in fact commissioned by railroads and resorts. Compared with the stark black-and-white Western scenes for which Jackson is known, this genre is appealing but quite different indeed. Hughes outlines Jackson's lengthy career and the Photochrom technique in an introductory essay. Aimed at a popular audience, this heavily illustrated volume will also appeal to those interested in photographia.<br><i>Kathleen Eagen Johnson, Historic Hudson Valley, Tarrytown, N.Y.</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Nurture: Give and Get What You Need to Flourish</h2><p><strong>Nurture</strong> (verb): 1. <em>To give tender care and protection. 2.

Organized alphabetically by gemstones, this historical and visual documentary elegantly displays the world's most famous jewelry collection intertwined with accounts of romance, intrigue, and politics. It offers an inside look at the tastes of each monarch, from Queen Mary's Delhi Durbar emeralds to Elizabeth II's diamond engagement ring designed by Prince Philip. The Jewels of the Duchess of Windsor documents the final chapter of this century's best-known love story, that of the Engish king who abdicated to marry American divorcee Wallis Warfield Simpson, and the sale of the historic collection of jewels he gave her. Rayner, however, curiously focuses on a biography of the Duke and the events leading to the fabled marriage. Beautifully illustrated, the catalog portion meticulously describes and displays each of the 214 pieces, ranging from memorabilia of the Duke to the exquisite jewels designed mostly by Cartier and Van Cleef and Arpels. Includes a list of prices from the sale of the collection in 1987. Carefully researched and designed, both books are recommended. Stephen Allan Patrick, East Tennessee State Univ.

And what&#39;s the connection with another dead girl, found in a deserted quarry? Miss Marple is invited to investigate the mystery before tongues start to wag...and another innocent victim is murdered in cold blood. The Moving Finger The quiet inhabitants of Lymstock are unsettled by a sudden outbreak of hate-mail. But when one of the recipients commits suicide, only Miss Marple questions the coroner&#39;s verdict. Is this the work of a poison pen...or a poisoner?

Her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, written towards the end of the First World War, introduced us to Hercule Poirot, who was to become the most popular detective in crime fiction since Sherlock Holmes. She is known throughout the world as the Queen of Crime. Her books have sold over a billion copies in the English language and another billion in over 100 foreign languages.

It was acquaintance with the medieval version of that work which inspired the anonymous author of&nbsp;<i>The Cloud of Unknowing</i>&nbsp;and led him to develop his insights and perceptions of the obscurity and &#x201c;unknowability&#x201d; of God. His understanding was that God was on an entirely different plane of existence from human beings&#x2014;indeed, so different that time-bound human language was inadequate to describe God exhaustively or accurately. Intellect and emotion both fail in seeking God, who can only be encountered by rejecting of all common earthly means in a &#x201c;cloud of forgetting&#x201d; and the discovery of Godself in the dark &#x201c;cloud of unknowing&#x201d; which can be pierced only with a &#x201c;lance of longing love.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Father John-Julian, OJN</b>, is an Episcopal priest and monk.

This type of acute inflammatory response is the body's reaction to trauma, and it's an essential part of the healing process. But inflammation can be harmful when it hangs around too long and refuses to leave. When the inflammation switch refuses to turn off, the body operates as if it is always under attack (the older we get, the more likely this is to happen). White blood cells flood the system for weeks, months, and even years. </p><p>Researchers are now linking low-grade, persistent inflammation to premature aging, heart disease, M.S., diabetes, Alzheimer's, psoriasis, arthritis, and cancer. <br>While anti-inflammatory drugs do exist, they can injure the stomach or suppress the immune system. Fortunately, the situation can be remedied by a change in diet, specifically by altering the kinds of fats you eat. Omega-3 fatty acids tend to decrease inflammation while omega-6 fats and trans-fats increase inflammation. While many foods in the standard American diet (unrefined white flour, sugar, red meat, diary, fast food, and food additives) exacerbate inflammation, a healthy diet made up of fish, nuts, seeds, oils, lean grass-fed meats, and fruits and vegetables can help lessen or prevent inflammation. Likewise, certain spices such as turmeric, cloves, and ginger have proven anti-inflammatory activity.</p><p><b><i>Anti-Inflammatory Foods for Health</i></b> will help those with inflammation incorporate anti-inflammatory foods into their everyday diet. Sample recipes may include French-Canadian Pea Soup, Sumac Salmon, Maple-Ginger Butternut Squash, Lime-Ginger Glazed Chicken with Fennel Relish, Green Salad with Grapes and Sunflower Seeds, Cod with Saffron Sauce, and more.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><p><p><b>Barbara Rowe</b>, MPH, RD, LD, CNSD, is the program manager at Johns Hopkins' Weight Management Center.

The original version of this guide has sold over 30,000 copies. This new edition has been expanded by 25% and promises to become an invaluable resource. For collectors, dealers and players, this completely updated &#34;field guide&#34; provides specifications, serial numbers, and more for determining the originality of vintage American acoustic and electric fretted instruments. Detailing thousands of models by every major manufacturer, the book now includes expanded coverage of Martin, Guild, Mosrite, Dobro, Gibson banjos, Fender amps, Gibson amps, plus updates on the latest models from Fender, Gibson, Rickenbacker, and others since 1990.</p><p>Authors George Gruhn and Walter Carter are no strangers to fretted instruments: Gruhn runs one of the best vintage instrument stores in the country, and Carter was Gibson's company historian for several years in the 1990s. In the second edition to <i>Gruhn's Guide to Vintage Guitars</i>, the pair have created a useful resource for any lover of fine guitars, banjos, or basses. Though not a price guide, the book will enable collectors to identify the date, stock ingredients, wood, and evolution of their Fender, Martin, Gibson, Gretsch, or Mosrite axes, to name just a few. Many readers will probably want to complement this book with a separate price guide (<i>The Official Vintage Guitar Magazine Price Guide</i> is recommended), and it should be noted that many mass-market manufacturers (Kay, for instance) were left out. But with this book you'll at least know that the stock Epiphone Madrid you bought on the Internet is, in fact, truly stock. A great resource for lovers of collectable six-strings. <i>--Jason Verlinde</i>The market for vintage American guitars, basses, amplifiers, banjos, ukuleles, and other fretted instruments has exploded in the last decade. This updated and expanded second edition of Gruhn's Guide is more than double the size of its first edition (1992) and is superior in breadth, depth, and timeliness. The guide is organized by manufacturer and type of instrument. Every model is described in detail, with introduction date, body shape and size, woods, pickups (where applicable), bindings, inlays, and finish. All changes made from year to year are noted, ensuring the precise determination of model and originality. The book also provides serial number lists, identification charts, and over 100 photos of special features. While many books on individual instrument makers are available, this is the only guide that lists all makers and all their products while also offering comments about the collectibility of specific instruments.

Some called it &#x201c;Fortress Rabaul,&#x201d; an apt name for the headquarters of the Imperial Japanese forces in the Southwest Pacific. Author Bruce Gamble chronicles Rabaul&#x2019;s crucial role in Japanese operations in the Southwest Pacific. Millions of square feet of housing and storage facilities supported a hundred thousand soldiers and naval personnel. Simpson Harbor and the airfields were the focus of hundreds of missions by American air forces.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Winner of the "Gold Medal" (Military Writers Society of America) and "Editor's Choice Award" (Stone &amp; Stone Second World&nbsp;War Books), <i>Fortress Rabaul</i> details a critical and, until now, little understood chapter in the history of World War II.</p></p><p><p> </p><p>Japan invaded the Southwest Pacific island of New Britain on January 23, 1942. Rabaul, on the northern tip of the island, was quickly developed into a major military complex. It served as a springboard for several new offensives and became the key to Japanese operations in the region. The mere mention of the island stronghold sent shudders through thousands of Allied airmen.&nbsp;</p> <p>Author Bruce Gamble chronicles the dramatic events that contributed to Rabaul&#x2019;s increasing notoriety, detailing the island&#x2019;s transformation into the ultimate twentieth-century fortification. Millions of square feet of new construction provided housing and storage facilities for a hundred thousand soldiers and naval personnel, and by mid-1943 Rabaul&#x2019;s air strength stood at six hundred planes.&nbsp;Some called it &#x201c;Fortress Rabaul,&#x201d; an apt name for Japan&#x2019;s mightiest base in the Southwest Pacific and the headquarters of the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x2019;s 8th and 11th Air Fleets.</p> <p>In the beginning, only the Royal Australian Air Force&#x2019;s 75 Squadron stood against the amassing Japanese force on New Britain, but there was an increasing presence of American squadrons in Australia joining the escalating air war over Rabaul. The virtually impregnable stronghold was the focus of attacks by American, Australian, and New Zealand air forces from January 1942 until the end of the war in August 1945, a total of forty-four months, the longest battle of World War II.</p> <p>Gamble fills in the historical background behind Rabaul&#x2019;s crucial role in the Pacific war, from the Japanese invasion through the shooting down of Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto on April 18, 1943, a turning point in Japan&#x2019;s offensive operations.&nbsp;A compelling story of military strategy and might, it is also a critical and, until now, little understood chapter in the history of World War II.</p><p></p><p> </p><p>As O&#x2019;Hare closed rapidly from the right side of the enemy formation, some of the Japanese gunners opened fire, intent on killing him first. Ignoring the tracers, O&#x2019;Hare took aim at the rearmost Mitsubishi and triggered a short burst with perfect deflection. The bomber piloted by FPO 2nd Class Ryosuke Kogiku careened out of formation, its starboard engine trailing smoke. O&#x2019;Hare lined up his sights on the next aircraft and got the same result. Ribbons of vaporized gasoline streamed from the perforated wing of FPO 1st Class Koji Maeda&#x2019;s bomber, which also veered out of formation.</p> <p>Pulling left to avoid the two stricken aircraft, O&#x2019;Hare let his fighter&#x2019;s momentum carry him under the formation. He crossed to the opposite side and then climbed back into firing position behind the last bomber on the left side of the formation. Aiming for the aircraft&#x2019;s opposite engine, he squeezed the trigger, and again his aim was true. The bomber shuddered under the impact of the heavy bullets and quickly fell behind, its right engine damaged and the left wing tank punctured. O&#x2019;Hare then fired a burst at the next bomber in line, which caught fire as he closed to nearly point-blank range. With just two brief firing runs, he had carved half of the bombers out of formation.</p><p></p></p><h2>SERPENTINE</h2><p>Tells the story of the crimes of a handsome young man and his accomplice, whose victims were tourists in Hong Kong, France, Greece, and Italy and whose methods were poisoning, burying, and burning</p><p>Award-winning writer Thomas Thompson (1933-1982) was born in Texas, USA. His first book Blood and Money made him a millionaire and the target of three libel suits. A prodigious researcher, he flew around the world three times and spent two years in Asia doing research for Serpentine."A book of remarkable sweep with a plausible underlying theme: coincidence, if traced back far enough, becomes something like destiny" is how LJ's reviewer adroitly summed up this book.

A Fine copy in a Fine dj.</p><p>In the absence of a shared social framework, how do we penetrate people's surface images to reach the real selves beneath their masks? This question preoccupies Katz in his billboard-like paintings, and it is also the concern of novelist and short-story writer Beattie. Her fictional sensibility seems well-attuned to this painter's world of alienation, conflict and sadness. This volume splices Beattie's cautious, probing essay with color reproductions of 26 of Katz's paintings. She shows how his freeze-framing techniques capture people at odds with themselves or off-kilter, individuals who have failed to connect. The paintings also analyze the subtle ways in which ordinary people reveal themselvesor try to evade doing so. Beattie, who interviewed some of Katz's subjects, puts her finger on the sense of the pictures as pregnant with a hidden narrative. Her readings of specific canvases help us guess what that narrative might be. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sea Snakes</h2><p>The sea is a habitat alien to most reptiles, and the adaptation of sea snakes to a marine existence is a fascinating chapter in biology. Sea Snakes describes the varieties and distributions of sea snakes, how they go about their daily lives underwater, what they eat and what eats them, and how they reproduce and grow. It also discusses how sea snakes cope with excess salt and scarcity of freshwater, and how they adjust to diving at depth and enduring long periods without breathing. The nature of their venom and how it functions in subduing large, active prey is also explained. Sea snakes interact with humans both in beneficial and in harmful ways. Harold Heatwole explains these and also discusses how we can best share the world with these beautiful and marvelous creatures.

As the story unfolds, we learn of both the highs of scientific discovery as well as the grueling yet essential routines that must be practiced every day just to stay alive in one of the harshest environments on our planet. Alternating with the author's wonder at the intense beauty of his surroundings are his immense frustration and boredom that stem from being completely at the mercy of the elements.<br> <br> Throughout the course of the expedition, danger is never far off in this inhospitable land. Despite having been trained in the art of building snow caves and practiced in the skill of traversing glaciers, Long tells of two brushes with death in just one afternoon. The hair-raising escape from a deep crevasse is fraught with tension-only to be followed by yet another encounter with sudden disaster when the crash of an avalanche buries Long deep in the snow.</p> Table of Contents<br><ul><li>Front Matter</li><li>A Strange and Hostile Land</li><li>Of Heroes, Rocks, and Fossils</li><li>Survival Training: Tekapo, New Zealand</li><li>Arrival in Antarctica</li><li>Antics on Ice</li><li>A Very Good Christmas</li><li>Dry Valleys, Sand Dunes, and Rivers</li><li>Back to the Great White South</li><li>Cape Evans and Cape Royds</li><li>A Flight of Discovery</li><li>On Mr. Darwin's Glacier</li><li>The First Worst Day of My Life</li><li>Dancing on the Gorgon's Head</li><li>Up the McCleary Glacier</li><li>A Room at the Fish Hotel</li><li>The Skua</li><li>The Ascent of Mt.

Long, a paleontologist, recounts his two expeditions (in 1988 and 1992) to Antarctica to recover some of these fossils. He relates details ranging from the thrilling to the mundane, describing plane rides to Antarctica, life at the base camp and his actual fieldwork. In a down-to-earth and often funny manner, he conveys a sense of the daily routine of a scientist living at the bottom of the world. At times the lay reader might get bogged down by some of Long's technical lexicon, but for the most part the author successfully intersperses accessible passages about the crew's more banal activitiesDcooking (including some recipes for Antarctic delicacies), celebrating Christmas, and playing in the snowDwith the passages concerning his work. Because these trips constitute Long's introduction to the continent, the book maintains a tone of immediacy and an infectious spirit of discovery, effectively articulating the awe experienced by first-time visitors upon confronting Antarctica's danger and beauty. Long supplements his own words with quotations from a variety of texts ranging from the diaries of famous Antarctic explorers to H.P. Lovecraft's fictional horror tale At the Mountain of Madness, from which this book takes its title. Although the narrative may not have enough action to satisfy hardcore exploration and adventure readers, it provides an informative, well-written and deliberate account of contemporary paleontological research, and presents some interesting theories on how Antarctica's resources could help solve certain environmental crises. Long's book should appeal to lay and professional readers interested in current scientific and ecological study.

Bruce D. Haynes and Syma Solovitch capture the tides of change that pushed blacks forward through the twentieth century&#x2015;the Great Migration, the Harlem Renaissance, the early civil rights victories, the Black Power and Black Arts movements&#x2015;as well as the many forces that ravaged black communities, including Haynes's own. As an authority on race and urban communities, Haynes brings unique sociological insights to the American mobility saga and the tenuous nature of status and success among the black middle class.<br><br>In many ways, Haynes's family defied the odds. All four great-grandparents on his father's side owned land in the South as early as 1880. His grandfather, George Edmund Haynes, was the founder of the National Urban League and a prot�g� of eminent black sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois; his grandmother, Elizabeth Ross Haynes, was a noted children's author of the Harlem Renaissance and a prominent social scientist. Yet these early advances and gains provided little anchor to the succeeding generations. This story is told against the backdrop of a crumbling three-story brownstone in Sugar Hill that once hosted Harlem Renaissance elites and later became an embodiment of the family's rise and demise. <i>Down the Up Staircase</i> is a stirring portrait of this family, each generation walking a tightrope, one misstep from free fall.</p><p><i>Down the Up Staircase</i> traces the social history of Harlem through the lens of one family across three generations, connecting their journey to the historical and social forces that transformed Harlem.

But in God&#x2019;s Year 1171, Henry Fitz Empress,&nbsp;second of that name to rule England since the Conquest, was more concerned&nbsp;with the judgment of the Church than History&#x2019;s verdict.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;When the Archbishop of Canterbury was slain in his own cathedral by men who&nbsp;believed they were acting on the king&#x2019;s behalf, their bloodied swords might well have&nbsp;dealt Henry a mortal blow, too. All of Christendom was enraged by Thomas Becket&#x2019;s&nbsp;murder and few were willing to heed Henry&#x2019;s impassioned denials of blame. His continental&nbsp;lands were laid under Interdict and his multitude of enemies were emboldened,&nbsp;like wolves on the trail of wounded prey. The beleaguered king chose to make a&nbsp;strategic retreat, and in October, he sailed for Ireland. There he soon established his&nbsp;lordship over the feuding Irish kings and secured oaths of fealty from the Irish bishops. The winter was so stormy that Ireland truly seemed to be at the western edge of&nbsp;the world, the turbulent Irish Sea insulating Henry from the continuing outcry over&nbsp;the archbishop&#x2019;s death.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;But in the spring, the winds abated and contact was established once more with&nbsp;the outside world. Henry learned that papal legates had arrived in Normandy. And he&nbsp;was warned that his restless eldest son was once more chafing at the bit. In accordance&nbsp;with continental custom, he had been crowned in his father&#x2019;s lifetime. But the young&nbsp;king was dissatisfied with his lot in life, having the trappings of shared kingship but&nbsp;none of the power, and Henry&#x2019;s agents were reporting that Hal was brooding about&nbsp;his plight, listening to the wrong men. Henry Fitz Empress decided it was time to&nbsp;go home.&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;<br><br>Chapter One<br>April 1172&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Dyved, South Wales&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></i>Soon after leaving haverford, they were ambushed by&nbsp;the fog. Ranulf had long ago learned that Welsh weather gave no fair&nbsp;warning, honored no flags of truce, and scorned all rules of warfare. But&nbsp;even he was taken aback by the suddenness of the assault. Rounding a bend in the&nbsp;road, they found themselves riding into oblivion. The sky was blotted out, the earth&nbsp;disappearing under their horses&#x2019; hooves, all sound muffled in this opaque, smothering&nbsp;mist, as blinding as wood-smoke and pungent with the raw, salt-tang of the sea.&nbsp;Drawing rein, Ranulf&#x2019;s brother Rainald hastily called for a halt.&#x201c;Mother of God,&nbsp;it is the Devil&#x2019;s doing!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Ranulf had a healthy respect for Lucifer&#x2019;s malevolence, but he was far more familiar&nbsp;than Rainald with the vagaries of the Welsh climate. &#x201c;It is just an early-morning&nbsp;fog, Rainald,&#x201d; he said soothingly.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I can smell the brimstone on his breath,&#x201d; Rainald insisted, &#x201c;can hear his cackling&nbsp;on the wind. Listen and you&#x2019;ll hear it, too.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Ranulf cocked his head, hearing only the slapping of waves against the rocks below&nbsp;them. Rainald was already shifting in the saddle, telling their men that they were&nbsp;turning back. Before Ranulf could protest, he discovered he had an ally in Gerald de&nbsp;Barri, the young clerk and scholar who&#x2019;d joined their party after a stopover at&nbsp;Llawhaden Castle.Kicking his mule forward, Gerald assured Rainald that such sudden&nbsp;patches of fog were quite common along the coast. They&#x2019;d soon be out of it, he promised,&nbsp;and offered to lead them, for this was a road he well knew.&nbsp;<br><br>Pressed, too, by Ranulf, Rainald reluctantly agreed and they ventured on, slowly&nbsp;and very warily. &#x201c;Now I know what it&#x2019;s like for your wife,&#x201d; Rainald grumbled, glancing&nbsp;over his shoulder at his brother. &#x201c;Poor lass, cursed to live all her days bat-blind and&nbsp;helpless as a newborn babe.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Ranulf&#x2019;s wife, Rhiannon, was indeed blind, but far from helpless. Ranulf took no&nbsp;offense, though; Rainald&#x2019;s tactlessness was legendary in their family. Slowing his&nbsp;mount, he dropped back to ride beside Rainald&#x2019;s young son. The boy&#x2019;s dark coloring&nbsp;had earned him his nickname, Rico, for upon viewing him for the first time, Rainald&nbsp;had joked that he was more an Enrico than a Henry, swarthy as a Sicilian. Rico&#x2019;s olive&nbsp;skin was now a ghostly shade of grey, and Ranulf reached over to pat him reassuringly&nbsp;upon the arm. &#x201c;Horses do not fancy going over cliffs any more than men do, and&nbsp;Welsh ponies are as sure-footed as mountain goats.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Rico did not seem comforted. &#x201c;Yes, but Whirlwind is Cornish, not Welsh!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Ranulf camouflaged a smile, for the placid hackney hardly merited such a spirited&nbsp;name. &#x201c;They breed sure-footed horses in Cornwall, too, lad.&#x201d; To take his nephew&#x2019;s&nbsp;mind off their precarious path, he began to tell Rico of some mischief-making by his&nbsp;youngest son,Morgan, and soon had Rico laughing.&nbsp;<br><br>He missed Morgan, missed his elder son, Bleddyn, and daughter,Mallt, above all&nbsp;missed Rhiannon. But he&#x2019;d agreed to accompany Rainald to the holy well of St Non,&nbsp;even knowing that he&#x2019;d be away for weeks, for he knew the real reason for Rainald&#x2019;s&nbsp;pilgrimage. Rainald had claimed he wanted to pray for his wife&#x2019;s soul. But Beatrice had&nbsp;been ailing for many years, hers a malady of the mind that only death had healed.&nbsp;Rainald&#x2019;s true concern was for his other son,Nicholas, who had not been blessed with&nbsp;Rico&#x2019;s robust good health. Frail and sickly, Nicholas was not likely to live long enough&nbsp;to succeed to his father&#x2019;s earldom, as evidenced by Rainald&#x2019;s desperate decision to seek&nbsp;aid from saints, not doctors.&nbsp;<br><br>Rainald&#x2019;s pain was all the greater because Nicholas was his only male heir. Rico&nbsp;was born out of wedlock, and thus barred by Church law from inheriting any of his father&#x2019;s&nbsp;estates&#x2013;even though Rainald himself was bastard-born. The irony of that was&nbsp;lost upon Rainald, who was the least introspective of men. It was not lost upon&nbsp;Ranulf, who shared Rainald&#x2019;s tainted birth, both of them natural sons of the old King&nbsp;Henry. Neither of them had suffered from the stigma of illegitimacy, though. As a&nbsp;king&#x2019;s son, Rainald had been judged worthy to wed the heiress of the earldom of Cornwall, and Ranulf had long been the favorite uncle of the current king, Henry Fitz Empress.<br><br>&nbsp;Henry would gladly have bestowed an earldom upon him, too, but Ranulf, who&nbsp;was half-Welsh, had chosen to settle in Wales where he&#x2019;d wed his Welsh cousin and&nbsp;raised his family&#x2013;until forced into English exile by a Welsh prince&#x2019;s enmity.&nbsp;<br><br>His Welsh lands were forfeit and his English manors were meager in comparison&nbsp;to Rainald&#x2019;s vast holdings in Cornwell, but Ranulf had no regrets about turning down&nbsp;a title. He was at peace with his yesterdays, and he&#x2019;d lived long enough to understand&nbsp;how few men could say that. For certes, Rainald could not. Nor could the king, his&nbsp;nephew, absent these many months in Ireland, where he&#x2019;d gone to evade Holy&nbsp;Church&#x2019;s fury over the slaying of Thomas Becket.&nbsp;<br><br>Gerald de Barri&#x2019;s voice floated back upon the damp morning air. A natural-born&nbsp;talker, he was not going to let a bit of fog muzzle him, and he continued to engage&nbsp;Rainald in conversation, not at all discouraged by the earl&#x2019;s taciturn, distracted responses.&nbsp;Ranulf listened, amused, for Gerald was an entertaining traveling companion,&nbsp;if somewhat self-serving. The nephew of the Bishop of St David&#x2019;s, he was&nbsp;returning to England after years of study in Paris, and he reminded Ranulf of Thomas&nbsp;Becket, another worldly clerk blessed with great talents and even greater ambitions.&nbsp;Becket had been a superb chancellor, wielding enormous influence because of his&nbsp;close friendship with the king. What a pity it was, Ranulf thought, that Harry had&nbsp;taken it into his head to elevate Becket to the archbishopric. But who could ever have&nbsp;expected the man to undergo such a dramatic transformation? He wasn&#x2019;t even a&nbsp;priest, had hastily to take holy vows just days before his investiture. But once he was&nbsp;Canterbury&#x2019;s archbishop, he&#x2019;d devoted himself to God with all of the zeal he&#x2019;d once&nbsp;shown on behalf of England&#x2019;s king. Henry hadn&#x2019;t been the only one discomfited by&nbsp;Becket&#x2019;s newfound fervor.His fellow bishops had often been exasperated by his provocations,&nbsp;his refusal to compromise, his self-righteous piety. Even His Holiness the Pope&nbsp;had been confounded at times by Becket&#x2019;s intransigence.&nbsp;<br><br>All that had changed, of course, as he bled to death on the floor of his own cathedral,&nbsp;and when the monks had discovered their slain archbishop&#x2019;s vermin-infested&nbsp;hair-shirt under his blood-soaked garments, none had doubted they were in the presence&nbsp;of sainthood. Acclaimed as a holy martyr in death, even by those who&#x2019;d considered&nbsp;him to be a vexation and an enigma in life, Thomas Becket was sure to be&nbsp;anointed as the Church&#x2019;s next saint. Already people flocked to his tomb at Canterbury,&nbsp;seeking healing cures and buying little vials of his blood as precious relics.More than&nbsp;fifteen months after Becket&#x2019;s death, Ranulf still marveled at it all. Was Becket truly&nbsp;a saint?&nbsp;<br><br>He smiled wryly, then, remembering his last meeting with his nephew the king,&nbsp;just before Henry&#x2019;s departure for Ireland. Over a late-night flagon of wine,Henry had&nbsp;challenged him, wanting to know if he believed Becket was a saint.He still recalled his<i>&nbsp;</i>reply. &#x201c;I cannot answer your question, Harry, doubt that anyone can. I do know,&nbsp;though, that saints are not judged like ordinary men. That is, after all, what makes&nbsp;them saints.&#x201d; Henry had reflected upon that in silence, then said, sounding both skeptical&nbsp;and regretful, &#x201c;Saint or not, Thomas got the last word for certes.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Menevia was the name given to the small settlement that had&nbsp;sprung up around the cathedral of St David. Its houses were outnumbered by shabby&nbsp;inns, stables, taverns, and a few cook-shops, for the shrine of the Welsh saint was a&nbsp;popular choice for pilgrimages. Because of its remoteness and the difficulty of travel&nbsp;in Wales, the Holy See had decreed that two pilgrimages to St David&#x2019;s were the equivalent&nbsp;of one to St Peter&#x2019;s in Rome. The cathedral itself was situated just west of the village&nbsp;in a secluded hollow, out of sight of the sea raiders and Norsemen who had&nbsp;pillaged the coast in bygone times.&nbsp;<br><br>The men expected to be accosted by villagers proclaiming the comforts of their&nbsp;inns, the superiority of their wines and mead, the bargain prices of their pilgrim&nbsp;badges. To their surprise, the streets appeared deserted. Advancing uneasily, they finally&nbsp;encountered an elderly man in a doorway, leaning heavily upon a wooden&nbsp;crutch.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Where have all the folk gone?&#x201d; Rainald called out, and when he got only a blank&nbsp;stare in response, Ranulf repeated the question in Welsh, to better effect.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;To the harbor,&#x201d; the ancient replied, hobbling forward a few steps. &#x201c;Sails were&nbsp;spied and when word spread, people went to see.Most pilgrims come on foot, but we&nbsp;do get some who sail from Normandy and Flanders, even a few Frenchmen who lack&nbsp;the ballocks to brave Welsh roads.&#x201d; He grinned, showing a surprising mouthful of&nbsp;teeth for one so old, but Ranulf knew the Welsh were particular about tooth care,&nbsp;cleaning them with green hazel shoots and polishing them with woolen cloth.&nbsp;Flipping him a coin for his trouble, Ranulf interpreted for the others, translating&nbsp;the old man&#x2019;s &#x201c;Frenchmen&#x201d; into &#x201c;English&#x201d; to avoid confusion. It was not always easy to&nbsp;live in lands with so many spoken tongues. To many of the Welsh, the invaders from&nbsp;England were French, for that was the language they spoke. To the French, those who&nbsp;dwelled on the rain-swept island were English. But those descendants of the men&nbsp;who&#x2019;d followed William the Bastard to victory in God&#x2019;s Year 1066 thought of themselves&nbsp;as Norman, and his nephew Henry was Angevin to the core.&nbsp;<br><br>Having no interest in incoming ships, they continued on toward the cathedral,&nbsp;where they received the welcome worthy of an earl, although Gerald de Barri was disappointed&nbsp;to learn that the bishop, his uncle, was away. They were escorted to the&nbsp;guest hall and were washing off the grime of the road when they heard shouting out&nbsp;in the close. Ranulf and Rainald hastened to the window, looking down at a man&nbsp;sprinting toward the bishop&#x2019;s palace. As several canons hurried to meet him, he sank&nbsp;to his knees, chest heaving.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;The king . . .&#x201d;He gasped, struggling for breath. &#x201c;The king is coming! His ships&nbsp;have dropped anchor in the harbor!&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><h2>Medieval History-Based Writing Lessons (Teacher&#39;s Manual only)</h2><p>Civilization, events, and major figures of the Middle Ages come alive as students write using IEW's stylistic techniques and the nine structural units.

He explores the competing traditions that still infuse environmental law and culture&#x2015;a frontier vision of settlement and development, a wilderness-seeking Romanticism, a utilitarian attitude that tries to manage nature for human benefit, and a twentieth-century ecological view. These traditions are ways of seeing the world and humans&#x2019; place in it. They are also modes of lawmaking that inscribe ideal visions on the earth itself. Each has shaped landscapes that make its vision of nature real, from wilderness to farmland to suburbs&#x2015;opening some new ways of living on the earth while foreclosing others.</p><p>The Anthropocene demands that we draw on all these legacies and go beyond them. With human and environmental fates now inseparable, environmental politics will become either more deeply democratic or more unequal and inhumane. Where nothing is pure, we must create ways to rally devotion to a damaged and ever-changing world.</p></p><p>Jedediah Purdy is Robinson O. Everett Professor of Law at Duke University School of Law.&#x201c;Dazzling... [Purdy&#x2019;s] book is, among other things, a panoramic tour of what he calls the &#x2018;American environmental imagination.&#x2019; ...Purdy hopes that climate change might spur yet another change in how we think about the natural world, but he insists that such a shift will be inescapably political... For a relatively slim volume, this book distills an incredible amount of scholarship&#x2015;about Americans&#x2019; changing attitudes toward the natural world, and about how those attitudes might change in the future.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ross Andersen</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Atlantic</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;For Purdy, one of the key challenges of the Anthropocene is to use the law in ways that adopt the best rather than the worst of each vision of nature: to integrate concern for human work and meaning into an ecological framework; to set standards for action on climate change; to make transparent the sources of our food and our treatment of animals...Purdy thinks we need to learn the core political lesson of his story&#x2015;which at its heart is not about the politics of nature, but about democracy. This is a history in which democracy is constantly evaded, decision-making is removed from collective politics by appeals to &#x2018;natural systems,&#x2019; and anti-politics creeps back in.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Katrina Forrester</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Nation</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Jedediah Purdy has written a big book, taking up a set of profound environmental questions and offering sweeping answers... The strengths of <i>After Nature</i> are significant and make this a must-read book for all who are struggling with how to reinvigorate environmental protection in the face of political breakdown in America and troubling global trends, including the emerging risk of climate change... The journey he maps is illuminating. In fact, perhaps the greatest strength of <i>After Nature</i> is its intellectual history of American environmentalism... With this book, Purdy shows himself to be a deep thinker on the nature of Nature... Purdy offers a provocative ecological vision and ethical argument that deserves to be reckoned with.

In the previous year, there&#x2019;ve been many studies of the deeper meaning of the Anthropocene and the future of humanity, studies ranging from the impenetrable to the inconsolable. <i>After Nature</i> is by a wide margin the best of these books; in its passion, intelligence, and persistent thread of hope, it may very well be the <i>Silent Spring</i> of the 21st century.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Steve Donoghue</b><b>, </b><b><i>Open Letters Monthly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Offers a powerful reckoning with our bewildering present...

To begin reading it is to open and decipher a compressed and encrypted file on a history of ideas about what nature means at the heart of the Anthropocene. Purdy draws on law, letters, philosophy, science, social science, politics, and aesthetics; from Locke, Rousseau, and Burke, through Jefferson, all the way to the recent past of the ecological age&#x2019;s beginnings, the urgent catastrophe of Rachel Carson&#x2019;s <i>Silent Spring</i> (1962), and our contemporary moment, after &#x2018;crisis had become the normal state of affairs,&#x2019; closing with ideas about nature and the posthuman from Rosi Braidotti, among others. Somewhere in between, Purdy manages to give a history of private property&#x2015;how &#x2018;each version of nature has its economy.&#x2019; If the ominous political near past and the planet&#x2019;s environmental emergency feel present on every page, so, too, does a sense of the role we each have in shaping the future.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Liz Larner</b><b>, </b><b><i>Artforum</i></b></p><h2>News of the World (Thorndike Press Large Print Western)</h2><p>&#34;In the aftermath of the Civil War, an aging itinerant news reader agrees to transport a young captive of the Kiowa back to her people&#34;--</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of October 2016:</strong> I&#x2019;ll admit, Paulette Jiles&#x2019;s <em>News of the World</em> was not at the top of my to-read pile. It&#x2019;s a post-Civil War western, the good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, and you can be sure the former will ride off into the sunset at the story&#x2019;s end (Womp, Womp). But, what is wrong with that, you say? As it turns out, not a darn thing. Captain Jefferson Kyle is a war-weary widower, traveling from town to town reading relevant bits of news to paying customers. In one such town he is given a $50 dollar gold piece to ferry a kidnapped girl back to what&#x2019;s left of her family--her parents and sister having been murdered by members of the Kiowa tribe--who spare the then 6-year-old and raise her as one of their own. Fast-forward four years and tribe life is the only life she knows, so she&#x2019;s not about to go quietly with a stranger who doesn&#x2019;t speak her language, whose motives she does not trust, and to a place that is not what she now considers home. Thus begins a seemingly ill-advised but transformative road trip where the mismatched pair eventually form and uneasy truce, then a not-so begrudging alliance, and finally something more wonderful that neither Captain nor kid could have imagined. Save for the carnage, this could be a great plot for Disney movie, and there is even a cinematic showdown thrown in for good measure. But in the complex world that we live in, sometimes it&#x2019;s nice to know who is wearing the white hats, and who is wearing the black hats, and to root for someone who&#x2014;out of a sense of duty, and later, love--is doing something pure and good. And that&#x2019;s what <em>News of the World</em> is: Pure and good. <em>--Erin Kodicek, The Amazon Book Review</em><p>In the aftermath of the Civil War, Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd drifts through northern Texas, performing live readings from newspapers to paying audiences hungry for news of the world&#x2014;of the Irish pouring into New York City, of the railroad driving into the new state of Nebraska, of an eruption of Popocat�petl near Mexico City. An elderly widower who has lived through three wars and fought in two of them, the captain once made his living as a printer, until the War Between the States took his press and everything with it. Now, at seventy-one, he enjoys the freedom of the road, even if his body aches and money is scarce.</p><p>At a stop in Wichita Falls, Captain Kidd is offered a fifty-dollar gold piece to deliver a young orphan to her relatives near San Antonio. Four years earlier, a band of Kiowa raiders viciously killed Johanna Leonberger&#x2019;s parents and sister; sparing the little girl, they raised her as their own. Recently recovered by the U.S. Army, the ten-year-old with blue eyes and hair the color of maple sugar has once again been torn away from the only home and family she knows. The captain&#x2019;s sense of duty and of compassion propels him to accept, though he knows the journey will be long and difficult. </p><p>Winding through unsettled territory and unforgiving terrain, the four-hundred-mile odyssey south proves dangerous as well. A corrupt Reconstruction administration runs the state government, and anarchy and lawlessness have taken hold. The captain must watch for thieves, Comanches and Kiowas, and the federal army&#x2014;and corral the wild Johanna. Small and thin, the despondent child has forgotten the English language, tries to escape at every opportunity, throws away her shoes, and refuses to act &#x201c;civilized.&#x201d; Yet as the miles pass, the wary Johanna slowly draws closer to the man she calls &#x201c;Kep-dun,&#x201d; and the two lonely survivors forge a bond that marks the difference between life and death in this treacherous land.</p><p>But in San Antonio another hurdle awaits, one that will force this respectable man to make a terrible choice that will determine Johanna&#x2019;s fate&#x2014;and his own.</p><p>Unfolding in gorgeous prose, <em>News of the World</em> is a vivid portrait that captures a beautiful and hostile land, and a masterful eploration of the boundaries of family, responsibility, honor, and trust.</p></p><h2>The Secret Language</h2><p>At first, Victoria North is miserable at the Coburn Home School.Her housemother is very strict, she's terribly homesick and the other girls don't seem to have any time for a shy new girl.<p>Then Vicky meets Martha Sherman, and everything changes.

If her paralyzing homesickness weren't enough, a stern, whistle-blowing housemother and unforgiving schoolgirls unlock a faucet of tears that just keeps coming. Partly because Victoria hates the Coburn Home School so much, her quirky and opinionated classmate Martha Sherman takes a liking to the shy new girl. And that's when things start looking up. In Martha's world, the word for wonderful is "leebossa" and sickeningly sweet is "ick-en-spick." Midnight feasts are plotted behind closed doors, a fabulous secret hut springs from old scraps, and a hidden world of tiny dolls emerges in a dresser drawer. Victoria's homesickness and Martha's general obstreperousness gradually evaporate as their friendship cements. Acclaimed children's book editor Ursula Nordstrom adeptly captures the anxious, earnest, mysterious world of the young girl, the wondrous "secret language" of childhood friendships, and the quirky 8-year-old logic that makes lavender a girl color and orange a boy color. Young readers will delight in finding a book that's written just for them, and adults will appreciate a strangely vivid trip back in time. <i>(Ages 8 to 11)</i>Ursula Nordstrom, director of Harper&#x2019;s Department of Books for Boys and Girls from 1940 to 1973, was arguably the single most creative force for innovation in children&#x2019;s book publishing in the United States during the twentieth century.

Managers who are also parents struggle to succeed-and be there for their families-in companies that don't offer flextime. Women and people of color want to make their organizations better for others like themselves-without limiting their own career paths. Environmentally conscious workers seek to act on their values and climb the executive ladder at firms more concerned with profits than pollution. <p>While many who don't "fit in" with the corporate culture choose to assimilate or leave, Tempered Radicals offers an inspiring alternative. In this provocative book, Debra Meyerson argues that this tension-between expressing our "whole selves" and building careers in companies that leave little room for differences-can pave the way for learning, leadership, and positive change in organizations. </p><p>Based on fifteen years of research and observation, Tempered Radicals reveals that adaptive, diverse, family-friendly, and socially responsible workplaces are built not by revolutionaries but by those she calls "tempered radicals"-people who successfully walk the tightrope between conformity and rebellion. Whereas "untempered" radicals use drama and heroics to effect change, these individuals work toward transformational ends with incremental means; whereas radicals lead episodically, tempered radicals lead every day-with conviction, patience, and courage.</p><p>Through stories of tempered radicals from doctors to teachers to CEOs to entrepreneurs, Meyerson illustrates how these "everyday leaders" stick to their values, assert their agendas, and provoke learning and change without jeopardizing hard-won careers. Whether one's difference stems from race, gender, sexual orientation, values, beliefs, or social perspectives, the book presents a spectrum of effective responses to the pressure to conform that range from resisting quietly to leveraging "small wins" to mobilizing others in legitimate but powerful ways.</p><p>Putting self-realization and change within everyone's reach, this book shows how to turn threats to our identities into opportunities to make a positive difference in our companies and in the world.</p><p>Debra E. Meyerson is visiting Professor of Organizational Behavior at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, and at the Center for Work, Technology, and Organization within Stanford's School of Engineering. She is also affiliated faculty at the Center for Gender in Organizations at the Simmons Graduate School of Management. She lives in Northern California. <br></p></p><p>"Tempered radicals" may not sound like the type to start revolutions or topple corrupt governments, but in the corporate world, it is often these quiet change advocates that get the ball rolling and policies changing. In her thoughtful study of employees whose differences place them outside the mainstream organizational culture, Debra Meyerson uses this term for those who want to succeed in their organizations without compromising their ideological beliefs and personal lives.<p> People who hope to "fit in without selling out" operate on a fault line, says Meyerson. While contributing to their companies' success, they support agendas that are often at odds with the dominant culture. This can involve their social identities, such as race, gender, or sexual orientation, or their philosophical values and beliefs, such as a concern for social justice, environmental sustainability, or family-friendly working conditions. They are not radicals in the sense that they want to enact a marked departure from the traditional, but tempered radicals in that they both challenge and uphold the status quo, working "within systems, not against them." Seeking to map the space between conformity and extreme radicalism, Meyerson conducted in-depth interviews with almost 200 people in three very different organizations (though both interviewees and companies were given pseudonyms, the companies are easily identifiable). The result is an insightful look at the way these people effect change, including the varieties of ways to stay true to oneself (through psychological, self-expressive, and behind-the-scenes resistance), how to leverage small wins, and how to organize collective action. There's also a lengthy chapter on the difficulties these tempered radicals face, from the psychological stress of constantly straddling a duality to the incremental lures of co-optation. Having taught in MBA programs at both the University of Michigan and Stanford University, Meyerson is an accomplished business professor; this book shows her to be a methodical researcher, sensitive interpreter of results, and well-organized and fluid writer, as well. <i>Tempered Radicals</i> is sure to be a beacon of inspiration for those wanting to make a difference from within and an inspiration to those who might have assumed that changing one's environment means changing one's job. --<i>S. Ketchum</i></p>This book could have just as easily been called How to Succeed without Selling your Soul &#x2013; a concern that may be particularly relevant during this period of retrenchment. I wrote Tempered Radicals about - and for - people who are committed to fitting in and succeeding in their organizations, yet also committed to a set of values or identities that are at odds with the majority culture. This speaks to a wide cast of people: progressives in conservative institutions (and vice versa), women in predominantly male organizations, active parents in all-consuming companies, people of color in predominantly white organizations, innovators in tradition bound organizations, environmentalists in profit centered companies, and so forth. Unfortunately, many people who feel misaligned with the organizational mainstream feel they must silence their personal values to fit in or leave the organization. In Tempered Radicals I illustrate a spectrum of constructive alternatives! ! . <p>Some of the people I&#x2019;ve written this book for may not immediately see themselves as &#x201c;tempered radicals.&#x201d; But almost fifteen years of research shows that when people act on values or views that depart from the organizational norm, they catalyze learning and change&#x2013; whether they intend to or not. </p><p>I wrote Tempered Radicals for people who navigate everyday the competing pulls between their own values and those of the surrounding culture. My hope is that the stories and strategies in this book will help people who identify with this tension feel less alone and more empowered to use their differences as powerful levers of leadership, learning, and positive change in their organizations. For years, I&#x2019;ve been inspired by these quiet, everyday acts of leadership that make a difference.</p></p><h2>GREAT NORTHERN?</h2><p><b>The Swallows, Amazons and Ds are united again for Arthur Ransome's final story in the series.</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flat on his front, binoculars to his eyes, alone at dusk, Dick makes a remarkable discovery: two rare birds, never before seen in the British Isles.

Once the uprising was smashed and the Dakotas captured, a military commission was convened, which quickly found more than three hundred Indians guilty of murder. President Lincoln, embroiled in the most devastating period of the Civil War, personally intervened in order to spare the lives of 265 of the condemned men, but the toll on the Dakota nation was still staggering: a way of life destroyed, a tribe forcibly relocated to barren and unfamiliar territory, and 38 Dakota warriors hanged&#x2014;the largest government-sanctioned execution in American history. <br><br>Scott W. Berg recounts the conflict through the stories of several remarkable characters, including Little Crow, who foresaw how ruinous the conflict would be for his tribe; Sarah Wakefield, who had been captured by the Dakotas, then vilified as an &#x201c;Indian lover&#x201d; when she defended them; Minnesota bishop Henry Benjamin Whipple, who was a tireless advocate for the Indians&#x2019; cause; and Lincoln, who transcended his own family history to pursue justice.<br><br>Written with uncommon immediacy and insight, <i>38 Nooses</i> details these events within the larger context of the Civil War, the history of the Dakota people, and the subsequent United States&#x2013;Indian wars. It is a revelation of an overlooked but seminal moment in American history.</p></p><p><p>Born and raised in the Twin Cities, <b>Scott W.

The author of <i>Grand Avenues: The Story of Pierre Charles L&#x2019;Enfant, the French Visionary Who Designed Washington, D.C.,</i> he is a regular contributor to <i>The Washington Post.</i></p><p>Chapter Five<br>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;<br>On Thursday, August 21, 1862, the news from Minnesota rode the wires thirteen hundred miles to Washington, D.C., and the telegraph room on the second floor of the War Department building, a few hundred steps across the west lawn of the White House. There it was transcribed and added to a stack of messages in the converted library facing Pennsylvania Avenue that had become a strategic crow&#x2019;s nest for Abraham Lincoln. The president&#x2019;s standard practice when awaiting bulletins from various fronts was to wear out the path to the War Department, climb the steps, and look through all of the telegrams. He would keep the messages in order until he stopped, turned to the telegraph operators, and said, &#x201c;Well, boys, I am down to the raisins.&#x201d; Borrowed from a doctor ministering to a vomiting child, the metaphor meant that he&#x2019;d reached a message he&#x2019;d seen on his previous visit. More than a routine, this was Lincoln&#x2019;s way of wresting control of the flow of information from his generals and wiring himself directly into the mechanism of the war. Earlier in the year all of the telegraph lines in the North had been placed under the control of the War Department, and since that time keeping up with the wired messages had become an obsession.<br>&nbsp;<br>The first telegram from Minnesota was addressed from Governor Ramsey to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. It began, &#x201c;The Sioux Indians on our western border have risen, and are murdering men, women, and children.&#x201d; A second message followed hard after, from Minnesota&#x2019;s secretary of state to Stanton&#x2019;s assistant war secretary, C. P. Walcott: &#x201c;A most frightful insurrection of Indians has broken out along our whole frontier. Men, women, and children are indiscriminately murdered; evidently the result of a deep-lain plan, the attacks being simultaneous along our whole border.&#x201d; Other communications from the frontier would soon follow, all elbowing for room among the business of the Civil War. Dozens of other messages in the pile had arrived this day from every part of the Union, almost all of them concerned with Lincoln&#x2019;s recent order that the states furnish 300,000 additional troops, asking questions about transport, outfitting, pay, mustering protocols, and timetables. There may have been no worse time during Lincoln&#x2019;s presidency&#x2014;or, for that matter, during the nation&#x2019;s history&#x2014;to convey such information with any hope of a speedy response.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thirteen months earlier Lincoln had finished his extraordinary first hundred days in office, shaking off the last lingering sense in the North and South that he was a country bumpkin elevated far above his station. He had turned the shelling of Fort Sumter into a Union rallying cry while managing to keep the border slave states in the fold; he had corralled, if not unified, a seemingly uncorrallable cabinet; and he had created an army and put it into motion across the famous &#x201c;thousand-mile front&#x201d; of the Civil War. These developments seemed to be a series of small miracles. Then, in July 1861, na�ve and high-spirited Union forces had been routed at Bull Run, just thirty miles southwest of the White House, and cold reality had set in.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gray and frostbitten February had brought the sudden sickness and death of his favorite son, Willie, after which First Lady Mary Todd descended into a grief so deep and lasting that her husband feared permanent madness was finally setting in. In March the ironclads Monitor and Merrimack had fought their famous battle in Tidewater Virginia, resulting in a standoff that kept the Confederate navy from approaching Washington, D.C., and April had seen Ulysses S. Grant&#x2019;s important victory at Shiloh. A growing attachment to Tad, his youngest son, began to mend Lincoln&#x2019;s heart, and as his spirits returned, so did his energy for war: he reorganized and reassigned many of his senior generals, created new military districts, and watched with satisfaction as the Union army headed toward Richmond with 58,000 troops. Early summer was an optimistic time, even for a leader as naturally suspicious of good news as Lincoln, but it was not to last. As the summer of 1862 wore on, Union forces began to founder badly.<br>&nbsp;<br>n June, Lincoln thought that General George B. McClellan had pinned Robert E. Lee to the ground at Richmond, but over a period of two discouraging weeks the Union forces had reversed direction, first mounting a fruitless siege and then conducting a series of retreats, a defensive strategy based on McClellan&#x2019;s astounding overestimations of Confederate manpower. Then, as the Northern army sat impotent on Virginia&#x2019;s James River, the greater portion of Lee&#x2019;s men headed north along a line that seemed to point straight at the White House. The failure to take Richmond or adequately cover Washington created embarrassing headlines&#x2014;the capital in danger!&#x2014;and had persuaded Lincoln to import yet another general from the West, John Pope, a young, portly engineer with old family connections to President Lincoln, and give him the job of keeping the &#x201c;secesh&#x201d; from marching across the Potomac River and up Pennsylvania Avenue.<br>&nbsp;<br>Pope had seen some small-scale success in early action along the Mississippi River and suffered no lack of confidence, but this didn&#x2019;t help him against Lee, who just two months into his command of the Army of Northern Virginia had already made every Union commander in the eastern theater look like a boy inexpertly playing a tabletop game of war. On August 19 Lincoln told his cabinet that he was now &#x201c;to have a sweat of five or six days&#x201d; as he waited to see if and when McClellan would coordinate with Pope to create a force of sufficient size to protect the capital and deal Lee a real blow. McClellan had finally been ordered to withdraw from the Peninsula to a position halfway up the Potomac River to Washington, and the general was following those orders, albeit with excruciating slowness.<br>&nbsp;<br>As Ramsey&#x2019;s telegram arrived on August 21, in the middle of Lincoln&#x2019;s &#x201c;sweat,&#x201d; generals, battles, and Indian uprisings took a back seat to a public letter written by Horace Greeley, publisher of the New York Tribune. It was an era of enormous power for newspaper editors, and Greeley was the most powerful of all, a man with astonishing influence and reach whose newspaper boasted the largest circulation of any in the world. Lincoln&#x2019;s early Whig principles had aligned with Greeley&#x2019;s politics&#x2014;the two had briefly served together in the House of Representatives&#x2014;but when Greeley supported the Democrat Stephen Douglas against Lincoln in his 1858 run for Illinois&#x2019;s open Senate seat, the two men had begun to walk around one another in wary, if mostly collegial, circles.<br>&nbsp;<br>Both men were Whigs turned Republicans with modest upbringings, and both were riding out tumultuous marriages while they bent their minds to the largest and most pressing crisis in their country&#x2019;s history. Greeley had admired Lincoln&#x2019;s Cooper Union speech, both for its plain poetry and because it was delivered with such aplomb and conviction to Greeley&#x2019;s own people, New York&#x2019;s intellectual and cultural elite. Their correspondence was frequent and usually friendly. But by the time the Civil War entered its second year, Greeley&#x2019;s ever more vocal anti-slavery stance and Lincoln&#x2019;s insistence that preserving the Union was his first and only priority put them in the situation of disagreeing fundamentally about executive policy while belonging to the same party and holding many of the same principles.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now that Lincoln&#x2019;s presidency had passed its first birthday and the war seemed ever more grim and intractable, Greeley had settled into a pattern of not-so-gentle prodding. What the editor wanted most of all was immediate emancipation. A proclamation to free all of the slaves was still far from an expression of the public will, nor was it Lincoln&#x2019;s strategy, but the president paid attention because Greeley was very smart, commanded a wide audience, and was the standard-bearer for liberal Republicans who might hold one key to increased support for the war. Entitled &#x201c;Prayer for Twenty Millions,&#x201d; Greeley&#x2019;s letter had been published in New York the previous day, but only on August 21, the same day that news of the Dakota uprising in Minnesota arrived, did a copy reach Lincoln&#x2019;s desk. The president read the text with care. Greeley&#x2019;s message, as he knew before he read the first word, was anything but a &#x201c;prayer.&#x201d; Rather, it was a 2,200-word accusation of dereliction laid at Lincoln&#x2019;s feet. Greeley opened by throwing down a gauntlet: &#x201c;[A] great proportion of those who triumphed in our election, and of all who desire the unqualified suppression of the Rebellion now desolating our country, are sorely disappointed and deeply pained by the policy you seem to be pursuing with regard to the slaves of the Rebels.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Idaho loners : hermits, solitaries, and individualists</h2><p>The gist of this book can be summed up in the words of Chinese hermit Shan-chuan: &#34;I have my place in the world.

They develop a theory of self-formation in which identities become the pivot between discipline and agency: turning from experiencing one's scripted social positions to making one's way into cultural worlds as a knowledgeable and committed participant. They emphasize throughout that "identities" are not static and coherent, but variable, multivocal and interactive.</p><p>Ethnographic illumination of this complex theoretical construction comes from vividly described fieldwork in vastly different microcultures: American college women "caught" in romance; persons in U.S. institutions of mental health care; members of Alcoholics Anonymous groups; and girls and women in the patriarchal order of Hindu villages in central Nepal.</p><p>Ultimately, <i>Identity and Agency in Cultural Worlds </i>offers a liberating yet tempered understanding of agency, for it shows how people, across the limits of cultural traditions and social forces of power and domination, improvise and find spaces to re-describe themselves, creating their cultural worlds anew.</p></p><p><p>Dorothy Holland is Boshamer Professor of Anthropology, Emeritus, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p><p>William S.

For centuries, their descendants lived with little contact from the western world. In 1778, their isolation was shattered with the arrival of Captain Cook.<br><br> Deftly weaving together a memorable cast of characters, <i>Lost Kingdom</i> brings to life the ensuing clash between a vulnerable Polynesian people and relentlessly expanding capitalist powers. Portraits of royalty and rogues, sugar barons, and missionaries combine into a sweeping tale of the Hawaiian Kingdom's rise and fall.<br><br> At the center of the story is Lili'uokalani, the last queen of Hawai'i. Born in 1838, she lived through the nearly complete economic transformation of the islands. Lucrative sugar plantations gradually subsumed the land, owned almost exclusively by white planters, dubbed the "Sugar Kings." Hawai'i became a prize in the contest between America, Britain, and France, each seeking to expand their military and commercial influence in the Pacific.<br><br> The monarchy had become a figurehead, victim to manipulation from the wealthy sugar plantation owners. Lili'uokalani was determined to enact a constitution to reinstate the monarchy's power but was outmaneuvered by the U.S. The annexation of Hawai'i had begun, ushering in a new century of American imperialism.</p><p>Julia Flynn Siler is an award-winning journalist.

She lives in Northern California with her husband and sons.The queen was back at the palace, just a few blocks from Honolulu Harbor, having been rebuffed two days earlier in her attempt to introduce a new constitution. Hearing the beat of the American military drums, she stepped onto the veranda and watched from above as the troops marched from the harbor. As they kicked up dust in the unpaved streets, she could see they were heavily weighed down with double belts of cartridges. The sun sank and the skies over Honolulu darkened. The blue-jacketed sailors approached the palace. <br><br>Beneath the town&#x2019;s newly installed electric streetlamps, Lili uokalani could see them pushing a revolving cannon and a fearsome Gatling gun that could rip through a large crowd. Following their movements in the streets, she felt fear. Why had the troops landed when everything seemed at peace? The air was heavy with the scent of gardenias. Mosquitoes were drawn to the sweat of the blue-jacketed sailors. As the troops marched past the palace grounds, accompanied by drum rolls, they hoisted their rifles to their shoulders and seemed to point them in the queen&#x2019;s direction. <br><br>Were their weapons drawn and ready to fire, as Lili uokalani later recalled? Or were they merely signaling their respect for Hawai i&#x2019;s queen by marching past and beating the drums in a royal salute, as one of their commanding officers later insisted? Whatever their intention, this brash display of military power ignited a crisis that would change the course of American history.<br></p><h2>As the Pig Turns: An Agatha Raisin Mystery (Agatha Raisin Mysteries)</h2><p><p><b><i>An irresistible new adventure for the bossy, vain, and endearing Agatha Raisin</i><i>&#x2015;now the star of a hit show on Acorn TV and public television&#x2015;</i><i>from </i>New York Times<i> bestselling M.C.

He presents the narration consistently and clearly with excellent dramatic pacing. &#34;The Leopard Lady,&#34; in which Cyril is so delicately disposed of, and &#34;The Cyprian Cat,&#34; in which Mrs. Merridew dies after the Cyprian cat is shot, are excellent examples of Sayers at her best.

Generations ago, the seemingly immortal wizard Od saved the city of Numis from destruction, not out of altruism but because it seemed like a nice place to found a school of magic. Over the years, the practice of magic has come more and more under the king's control. Deciding to stir things up, Od recruits Brenden Vetch, a gardener from the northlands with tremendous raw power and no taste for politics. As Brenden arrives in Numis, so does a fabulous street magician, Tyramin, whose sleight-of-hand looks suspiciously like unauthorized wizardry. King Galin's attempts to control Brendan and arrest Tyramin only scare them away and earn him the scorn of his daughter, Sulys. As with the Narnia books and other fantasy classics with religious or political agendas, if you can shut off your awareness of worldly context, you'll find this an otherworldly delight. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tour.</p><p><b>Kate Kelly</b> is a master's prepared clinical specialist in psychiatric nursing. Her professional background includes experience as as a therapist, assistant professor and clinical coordinator for psychobiological research. Her graduate education focused on chronic mental illness, and this orientation eventually led her to an interest in the mental health self-help movement. She became a champion for individuals with severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, believing that even those with severe impairments could learn to manage their own illnesses. <p> Ms. Kelly's prior publishing credits include an article entitled <i>Fostering Self-Help on an Inpatient Unit,</i> published in the <i>Archives of Psychiatric Nursing.</i> This article chronicled the results of her work in developing a model for an inpatient group that helped chronically mentally ill patients learn and share effective coping strategies. </p><p> Following her diagnosis with ADHD in 1989, Ms. Kelly's work moved in a new direction. Combining her personal and professional interests in adult ADD, she began to focus on this emerging area of mental health. Responding to the need to provide services for ADD adults, she founded the adult support group of the Attention Deficit Disorder Council of Greater Cincinnati in February of 1990. Although she no longer facilitates this group, she continues to consult with the Council on adult ADD and support group issues. </p><p> The information Ms. Kelly gathered from available literature and the personal stories of ADD adults in Cincinnati and nationwide lead to her work in writing <i>I'm Not Lazy, Stupid or Crazy!?</i> Currently she is using her personal and professional experiences and knowledge to give presentations on adult ADD for lay and professional groups. She also works in private practice leading psychoeducational therapy groups for ADD adults.</p><p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <b>From the Porch to the Printed Page: A Reader's Guide to Understanding This Book</b> </p><p> Dear Reader: </p><p> <b>Please don't skip this section!</b> Although it's really a preface, we've written it as a separate chapter. We thought that many of our readers might approach a new book the way we do -- by skipping the miscellaneous pages and jumping right into the good stuff! But the information in this brief section is too important to gloss over. It will help answer some of the questions you may have as you go along. </p><p> Over two years ago, we sat on a porch swing and shared our vision for this book. Our original ideas took the form of a three page outline which became our framework throughout the writing process. Many long days and countless revisions later, our original <i>Porch Swing Planning</i> session evolved into the book you are about to read. </p><p> During the writing process, our vision changed little from our original outline. The chapter you are reading now is the only addition. We chose to add this section to share with our readers the underlying philosophy that guided our writing and the decisions we made regarding the book's format. </p><p> In the Introduction, we explained our goal of writing a book an ADD adult could use to understand and manage her disorder. We wanted this book to be practical and easy to read for anyone with specific reading and language deficits. To that end, we chose an informal writing style and worked hard to minimize the complexity of some rather complicated scientific concepts. We also included numerous cartoons to make the text more understandable. </p><p> We would like to comment on the organization of this book before you begin reading the three chapters that follow and question what we just said about ease of reading! During the editing process, we agonized over these early chapters that aren't as easy to read as the rest of the book. They are densely packed with rather technical information that is difficult to simplify. We didn't want to lose readers who might react in one or more of the following ways: 1. "Have I been tricked? Is this a text book? I thought it was going to be a practical, self-help book!" 2. "I've already read this information in several other books." 3. "How is this book going to help me if I can't understand the first chapter?" </p><p> We considered a variety of options from eliminating some of the information to reorganizing the format. We concluded that none of the options would solve the problem. We knew that our readers would have varying levels of knowledge about ADD and that some would need an in-depth introduction to the disorder. We were also keenly aware of the curiosity of ADDers who don't often accept suggestions without first asking, "But why?" We decided that without this background information, the anecdotes and practical suggestions that followed wouldn't make much sense. So we chose to leave the format alone and to offer the following guidelines. </p><p> If you've already done extensive reading in ADD, you might want to just browse these chapters. If you're new to ADD, just hang in there with the early chapters, taking them at your own pace and allowing time to digest the material. If you get really bored or befuddled, take a break! We promise the going will get easier and later chapters will take a look at the lighter, more practical side of ADD. </p><p> We also want to explain how we deal with the issue of sexist language in this book. The seeming erratic use of "he" and "she" isn't an editing error! We chose to alternate the use of male and female pronouns by chapters. As you will discover as you read this book, ADD isn't just a problem for boys and men. The assumption that the majority of ADDers are male has been challenged as knowledge about ADD has grown. Since this book is for all of you, men and women alike, we wanted to make the language as inclusive as possible. So, the odd numbered chapters use female pronoun references and the even chapters, male. By the way, there is no significance, other than a flip of a coin, for beginning with <i>she</i> instead of <i>he!</i> Paralleling this issue of sexist language, we have also tried to avoid stereotypes, including examples of both men and women in non-traditional roles. This seems appropriate, particularly since ADDers tend to be rather non-traditional folk. </p><p> Finally, we want to include a word of caution. In reviewing the book, a nationally known ADD expert raised an important issue. He voiced his concern that every adult who read it could identify with the described ADD behaviors and make a self-diagnosis of ADD. This concern is valid. In our work with classroom teachers, many report that the manifestations of ADD characterize every child in their classrooms! </p><p> We want to emphasize that ADD is a complicated syndrome with diverse symptoms of varying degrees of severity. It isn't surprising that educators observe ADD behaviors in many of their students because the symptoms of ADD are an exaggeration of behaviors and experiences that fall within the normal human range. Anyone can sometimes have lapses in memory, act impulsively or have difficulty concentrating. The problem with ADD is one of degree and persistence of the symptoms over time and across varying situations. ADDers have symptoms that begin in childhood and cause significant problems in school, work and relationships. </p><p> Another part of the diagnostic dilemma is that various mental health problems have symptoms that overlap those of ADD. For example, people with schizophrenia or depression have information processing problems similar to ADD adults but often to a greater degree. Virtually all mental health problems interfere with organization and information processing. So, it's not hard to imagine ADD becoming the new bandwagon everyone wants to jump on. We can picture the consternation of mental health professionals confronted with offices filled with people demanding treatment for the ADD they've self-diagnosed. </p><p> We can't emphasize enough that a diagnosis is not a <i>do-it-yourself</i> enterprise. A person with schizophrenia, for example, might have attention deficits but her treatment would be radically different from that of an ADDer. Using stimulant medication in her treatment would likely have the effect of dramatically worsening her condition. The point is, an accurate diagnosis is an essential component of treatment. </p><p> This book isn't a scholarly, diagnostic manual. Several excellent books of that kind are available and are listed in the appendix. If you're reading this book because you suspect you have ADD, follow the guidelines in Chapter 6. Develop a relationship with a professional who can provide a formal evaluation and diagnosis. </p><p> We don't believe, however, that an official ADD diagnosis is a prerequisite for reading this book. Individuals with other mental health problems and those without symptoms sufficiently severe to be considered ADD, can benefit from some of this material. Many of the self-help strategies are useful with or without a specific diagnosis. For example, a reader doesn't have to know why she is disorganized to benefit from some of our suggestions in Chapter 13. In addition, we hope that spouses, friends and colleagues of ADDers and other adults who struggle with related problems will read this book and develop greater sensitivity to individuals with special needs. We can all benefit from understanding how glitches in brain processes can wreak havoc in the daily lives of many people. </p><p> Finally, we hope that you'll find this book enjoyable and informative. If our readers have half as much fun reading it as we have had writing it, we will have accomplished our mission. We welcome your comments, personal experiences or anything else you would like to share with us. </p><p> Sincerely,<br> <i>Kate Kelly and Peggy Ramundo</i> </p><p> Copyright � 1993 by Kate Kelly and Peggy Ramundo</p></p><h2>Illustrated Guide to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo</h2><p>An immense reservoir of art history, Cairo's Museum of Egyptian Antiquities contains fabulous collections of relics from the Mediterranean's most mysterious and ancient civilization, the true cradle of western culture. From the creation of the first state on the banks of the Nile to its submission to the Roman empire, the millennial story of ancient Egypt is recounted here through the artistic masterpieces, the everyday objects, the spectacular jewels, and the magnificent remains from the tombs of the pharaohs, all remarkably assembled within the walls of a single institution.<br><br>Structured as a guide, but fully illustrated with superb color photographs, this book suggests a simple but comprehensive itinerary through the museum, subdividing the tour into chapters devoted to the most important episodes in Egyptian history. Collected during the course of over a century of archaeological excavations, jewelry, tools, toys, models, religious objects, mummies, and monumental sculptures offer vivid glimpses of a formidable civilization. The rich funerary cache of Tutankhamun, the treasures of Tanis, and the jewels of Queen Ahhotep reflect the glory of the Egyptian monarchy, but there are insights too into the day-to-day lives of the more humble sections of society. Previously unpublished photographs and plans alongside texts prepared by the museum curators themselves help readers to penetrate the corridors and halls of the great museum in search of a heritage unique in its richness and variety, following in the footsteps of the great figures in Egyptian history: from the pharaohs, suspended between heaven and earth, to the archaeologists who, with their patient excavations, have helped to shed new light on the land of the pyramids.</p><p>ZAHI HAWASS, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Cairo, received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania and has been excavating in Egypt for over thirty years.

Granted, these aren't graphic novels, but they fit right in as many kids want to draw their own comics and create their own stories. By a familiar writer of how-to-draw books, these large-format paperbacks explain the basics of drawing in the style of anime (Japanese animated films) and manga (Japanese comics). Hart's enthusiastic approach energizes the texts, and both books are loaded with full-color illustrations that will surely attract readers. <i>Kids,</i> for the younger end of the audience range,<i></i> moves quickly through the preliminaries of sketching "big-eye" characters' physical attributes, then goes on to demonstrate how to put figures in motion and, using a few successive drawings, how to create some typical characters. Kids who want detailed anime instructions will need to look elsewhere; those who just want some basics will find plenty here. <i>Mech Mania</i>, aimed at older readers with more art experience, focuses on the futuristic robots, vehicles, and weapons found in anime and manga scenes as well as in video games. From the blueprints for a spaceship to advice on showing characters in action or revealing a robot's mood through its posture, this dynamic book offers a useful mix of creative inspiration and practical advice. Hart ends with an informative interview with the art director of Microsoft's Fasa Studio. Slick, heavy paper, vibrant colors, and sharply defined lines in the finished illustrations add to the appeal and make these books sturdier than most paperbacks. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He won the Most Valuable Player award and figured importantly in the World Series, chiefly because of a catch he made to preserve Don Larsen's perfect game. Mantle writes as well of his notorious escapades with Whitey Ford and Billy Martin and of his special relationship with manager Casey Stengel, but what readers will carry away is the picture of a fierce competitor who also seems to be a warm and generous-hearted human being.

These majestically beautiful birds breed on northern lakes during the spring and summer, and when fall arrives, they migrate to open coastal waters.

It is the story of Stephen, a young Englishman, who arrives in Amiens in 1910. Over the course of the novel he suffers a series of traumatic experiences, from the clandestine love affair that tears apart the family with whom he lives, to the unprecedented experiences of the war itself.</p><p>Readers who are entranced by the sweeping Anglo sagas of <i>Masterpiece Theatre</i> will devour <i>Birdsong</i>, Sebastian Faulks's historical drama. A bestseller in England, there's even a little high-toned erotica thrown into the mix to convince the doubtful. The book's hero, a 20-year-old Englishman named Stephen Wraysford, finds his true love on a trip to Amiens in 1910. Unfortunately, she's already married, the wife of a wealthy textile baron. Wrayford convinces her to leave a life of passionless comfort to be at his side, but things do not turn out according to plan. Wraysford is haunted by this doomed affair and carries it with him into the trenches of World War I. <i>Birdsong</i> derives most of its power from its descriptions of mud and blood, and Wraysford's attempt to retain a scrap of humanity while surrounded by it. There is a simultaneous description of his present-day granddaughter's quest to read his diaries, which is designed to give some sense of perspective; this device is only somewhat successful. Nevertheless, <i>Birdsong</i> is an unflinching war story that is bookended by romances and a rewarding read.<b>Birdsong</b> was voted <b>one of the best books of the century</b> in a poll conducted by Waterstone's booksellers and Channel Four TV in the United Kingdom. Here's a selection of the praise that has been pouring in:<p>"<b>Birdsong</b> moved me more profoundly than anything I've read in years ...

Fourteen activist ministers and lay leaders apply a keen intersectional analysis to the environmental crisis, revealing ways that capitalism, white supremacy, patriarchy, and other systems of oppression intersect with and contribute to ecological devastation. They also explore how spiritual practices, congregational organizing, and progressive theology can inform faith-based justice work in the twenty-first century. These prophetic voices, from a wide range of perspectives, reveal new approaches and opportunities for more holistic, accountable, and connected justice efforts. Each essay is accompanied by suggested ways to take the next steps for further learning and action.</p><p>Manish Mishra-Marzetti serves as senior minister of The First Parish in Lincoln, Massachusetts, a dual Unitarian Universalist Association and United Church of Christ member congregation. He has served extensively in UU leadership, including in his current role as a trustee on the UUA Board of Trustees.<br>Jennifer Nordstrom is the senior minister of the First Unitarian Society of Milwaukee. She is the founder of the Unitarian Universalist Young Adults for Climate Justice.Justice on Earth is energizing and illuminating reading it filled me with motivation to work towards environmental justice in prophetic and deep ways, grounded in Unitarian Universalist faith community and values. I hope every Unitarian Universalist will read this book and take its messages to heart and into the world. --Aly Tharp, Program Director, Unitarian Universalist Ministry for Earth<br><br>The steepest hill to climb in the Unitarian Universalist Association's Green Sanctuary Program is the required environmental and climate justice engagement. That is because many of us are still laboring under the problematic "traditions" of charity as primary or sole strategy (rather than partnership or following leadership from front line communities), and approaching justice issues as if they can be separated from one another. The Unitarian Universalist - sourced essays and stories in this book bring together pieces that have before now been spread through diverse disciplines. This collection has what I believe is needed for UUs who care about the environment and justice to deepen individual and collective understanding of the intersectional realities of environmental and climate justice. Through the lens of this book comes understanding that is difficult for many of us, but also beauty and joy that spring from alternatives discovered only together in relationship across boundaries. --Rev.

By the illustrator of <i>How Many Bugs in a Box. </i></p><p>PreSchool-Grade 1-- This serviceable interpretation of the traditional verse may not be needed in collections that already own Rojankovsky (HBJ, 1973) or Keats's versions (Four Winds, 1972; o.p.). Carter's collage illustrations are closer in style to the latter, but his animals seem stilted and stylized compared to Keats's work. Vibrant color is one of this book's strengths, as is the clever use of stamping texture on the collage figures. The entire rhyme is is printed at the back of the book; unfortunately, the musical score is not included. Many primary classrooms use this repetitive rhyme for introducing math and reading skills. Another look at an old favorite, but nothing new. --Mollie Bynum, Chester Valley Elementary School, Anchorage, AK<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hudson River School Paintings, Wadsworth Atheneum: A Book of Postcards</h2><p>Rear cover notes: &#34;The Hudson River School of painters left a notable legacy to American art, embodying the reverence for nature and the national idealism that prevailed at the middle of the nineteenth century.

F. Moulton and A. S. Geden. Originally published in 1897, it has remained in print ever since. It is beyond any doubt the most useful basic tool available for the student of the New Testament. The original edition was primarily based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort, but gave all the variants in the edition of Tischendorf and in the Greek text underlying the Revised Version of the English Bible; quotations are given with grammatical completeness as far as possible; a significant feature is the inclusion of the Hebrew text of direct quotations from the Old Testament; asterisks and daggers indicate whether the vocabulary items in the New Testament are found in Classical Greek and in the Septuagint.This new edition retains all the features of the earlier editions, but it is primarily based on the Greek text in The Greek New Testament (4th edition), which is identical with that in Novum Testamentum Graece (27th edition), currently the two most widely used editions of the Greek New Testament; it incorporates the main marginal readings in the former of these texts; references to the variants in the older editions are preserved, so that the student has to hand every reading which by even a remote probability might be regarded as forming part of the true text of the New Testament. The Supplement incorporating the prepositions has been included in the main text of the Concordance. Where the same word occurs twice in the same verse, these occurrences are now printed on separate lines and individually verse-numbered so that it is easier to count the number of occurrences of any given word. Special new Greek fonts have been created to enable great clarity in the printing.</p><p>Text: Greek, English</p><h2>My Damage: The Story of a Punk Rock Survivor</h2><p>Keith Morris is a true punk icon. No one else embodies the sound of Southern Californian hardcore the way he does. With his waist-length dreadlocks and snarling vocals, Morris is known the world over for his take-no-prisoners approach on the stage and his integrity off of it. Over the course of his forty-year career with Black Flag, the Circle Jerks, and OFF!, he's battled diabetes, drug and alcohol addiction, and the record industry...and he's still going strong.<br><br><i>My Damage</i> is more than a book about the highs and lows of a punk rock legend. It's a story from the perspective of someone who has shared the stage with just about every major figure in the music industry and has appeared in cult films like <i>The Decline of Western Civilization</i> and <i>Repo Man</i>. A true Hollywood tale from an L.A. native, <i>My Damage</i> reveals the story of Morris's streets, his scene, and his music-as only he can tell it.<br></p><p><b>Keith Morris</b> is a cofounding member of Black Flag, the most recognizable name in West Coast punk, and the Circle Jerks, which cemented his reputation at the forefront of hardcore vocalists. He has recorded over fifteen albums, appeared on countless albums and compilations, and has a half-dozen film credits to his name. The intensity of the music produced by his latest bands OFF! and FLAG are equal to his best work from the '70s, '80s, and '90s, and add to a legendary career that is still being carved out one gig at a time.<br><b>Jim Ruland</b> caught the punk rock virus when his mom took him to see the Ramones when he was 15. He has been writing for punk rock zines like <i>Flipside</i> since the early '90s and has written for every issue of <i>Razorcake</i>, America's only non-profit independent music fanzine. He is the author of the award-winning novel <i>Forest of Fortune</i> and the short story collection <i>Big Lonesome</i> and is the curator of the irreverent reading series Vermin on the Mount.I came late to Southern California and its Punk Rock scene, but after reading Keith Morris's memoir, feel I was there from the start. <i>My Damage</i> is like Neal Cassady's <i>The First Third</i> read aloud by William Burroughs for his private enjoyment: clear and unapologetic as a bell, fast as you can go, a rolling dumpster on fire, and a treasure trove for any student of West Coast Punk history. Lonely, funny, brave, tragic, anonymous, and famous all at once, until the moon disappears and everything goes to sleep. And wakes up again to dream a new song.&#x201d;<b> Viggo Mortensen</b><br><br> Kill your idols, please. Check that tired rock star shit at the door. Keith Morris is nothing less than a living, breathing symbol. He's a snot-voiced, Southern California archetype and prototype, an influential fuckup whose ripple effect in punk has been felt every single day since he spat out, I'm about to have a nervous breakdown' in 1979. Without <i>My Damage</i>'s middle-finger-shaped piece snapped into place, no history of L.A.'s punk rock puzzle is complete.&#x201d;<b> Todd Taylor, <i>Razorcake</i></b><br><br><b>Praise for Keith Morris and <i>My Damage</i></b><br><br>"Keith Morris is a human firecracker. You can literally hear his leg kicking under the table as you rip through the pages. If his life were the bars, these words are the file hidden in the cake. He is as truthful as funny, and if you don't read this book you might as well join an REO Speedwagon cover band.&#x201d;<b> Ryan Adams</b><br><br> Keith Morris, survivor of bouncers and blacklisters, thrown down the stairs yet still standing tall, damaged, patched up, last laugher of all, this is the punk rock story I've always wanted to hear.&#x201d;<b> Exene Cervenka of X</b><br><br>"In <i>My Damage</i>, Keith Morris lets loose with a shotgun blast of funny, often harrowing vignettes/opinions in every chapter, chronicling growing up in Los Angeles' South Bay and the evolution of not just Southern California punk (and his part), but rock music in general, from the late 1960s up to the present.

Just as he opened readers&#39; eyes with his bold statements in The Grace Awakening, now he offers a straightforward volume revealing how to reestablish a life-altering church with Christ as Lord and Master. Illuminating and empowering, THE CHURCH AWAKENING will ignite a revolution in the way Christians &#34;do church&#34; for years to come.</p><p>Charles Swindoll has devoted over four decades to two passions: an unwavering commitment to the practical communication and application of God's Word, and an untiring devotion to seeing lives transformed by God's grace.

Eve (the name inscribed inside the front cover and then again above the heading for chapter 3) made pencil marks on nearly every paragraph of the book, underlining a phrase, highlighting many passages with strong vertical marks, scratching out some words that she seems to have found superfluous and even x-ing out whole sections that apparently missed their mark with her altogether. Two rusting paper clips isolate several pages, absent any marking at all. Anne Morrow Lindbergh&#39;s lyrical words are still relevant and presage so many of the themes of today&#39;s most popular books: simplicity, peaceful solitude, caring for the soul, a woman finding her place in society and life. I heard that the woman who had lived in the cabin had actually passed away some time before.

How much more effective and powerful would we all be if we replaced our current patterns of competition, criticism, and comparison with collaboration, cooperation, and compassion?<br> <br> Putting these values at the center of our lives allows each of us to be happier and more empowered, and to replace harmful habits with a more positive, peaceful, and rewarding way of being. <i>We</i> is a rallying cry for &#x201c;every woman, everywhere on the planet.

Sometimes it&#x2019;s so quiet we can barely hear it &#x2013; a soft tapping. No louder than a leaf falling from a tree.<br><br>We may imagine we didn&#x2019;t hear it. Or perhaps it is louder and takes the form of a persistent ache, a nagging sense that there is something missing. &#x2018;Is this it?&#x2019; we wonder when we wake in the dead of night or find ourselves caught in the treadmill of our daily grind.<br><br>It may be a hint of loneliness that endures even in the company of friends. Or a sense of injustice and a desire to change things that feels urgent and necessary, but also hopeless before it even begins.<br><br>Perhaps our heart tells us there is a better way of living, that we need to stop ignoring what really matters &#x2013; the suffering of others and our planet&#x2019;s future &#x2013; but our head insists we&#x2019;re na�ve and tells us to knuckle down and get on with our lives as they are.<br><br>For others the call may take the form of a crisis &#x2013; a break-up or breakdown, a betrayal or loss. Or perhaps it&#x2019;s addiction, depression, or another serious illness.<br><br>However it comes, it is an invitation to take a journey. You may resist. Many of us have resisted it for years, even decades. Ultimately it&#x2019;s your choice. But it will wait for you patiently, tapping daily or every so often in small and big ways to remind you that, in truth, you can&#x2019;t avoid it if you truly want to live a meaningful life.<br><br>If you&#x2019;ve heard that call, this book is for you. It&#x2019;s for women who want happiness and meaning. It will guide you towards the path to inner peace and provide the power to help transform the world in which we all live.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE JOURNEY<br><br>WE is a journey based on a set of nine principles that have been taught by sages and saints throughout the ages and which have the power to transform your life and the world around you.<br><br>It isn&#x2019;t a lifestyle choice to be bolted onto our normal me-centred way of living; it&#x2019;s a path of radical transformation that puts compassion for the world at its core.<br><br>Use this book both as a guide and a source of inspiration. If you&#x2019;re hurting, it will help you heal. If you&#x2019;re lost, it will guide you home. If you&#x2019;re searching for a purpose, it will gently lead you towards fulfilment.<br><br>We arrive in this world without instruction manuals and we grow up without an emotional toolkit. So it&#x2019;s easy to lose our way.<br><br>As we go through life we amass emotional scar tissue from the knocks that we inevitably take. We become like electrical circuit boards that have got so clogged up by the silt of life that we can no longer connect with ourselves and our core beliefs, let alone with the world beyond.<br><br>All of us start out in life with a strong internal value system &#x2013; a sense of what&#x2019;s right and wrong and what&#x2019;s fair and what&#x2019;s unjust. But then life intervenes. In the cold light of reality our ideals can quickly seem na�ve, unrealistic and untenable. However strong and heartfelt our intentions, it&#x2019;s hard to give effect to our beliefs when we&#x2019;re struggling, stressed or in emotional pain.<br><br>Before long we&#x2019;ve abandoned those values in favour of the rules we&#x2019;re taught by the world. Succeed, compete and accumulate. Deep down we feel conflicted, but at the end of the day we each have to get by, don&#x2019;t we?<br><br>A gulf emerges between the values we choose for our personal lives and those we live by in the world at large. In our homes and families we believe in sharing and making sure everyone&#x2019;s OK. But once we step outside our front door the rules change. The common good is replaced with the quest for personal success. Within seconds <i>we </i>dissolves into <i>me</i> and we&#x2019;re elbowing each other out of the way in the race to get to the finishing line. Only, of course, there isn&#x2019;t one &#x2013; just a horizon that moves further away the closer we get.<br><br>The Nine Principles in this book heal our wounds and return us to our centre. As you learn to apply them to your life one by one, you will be taken on a journey from <i>me</i> to <i>WE</i>. Loneliness will evaporate. You will discover a sense of purpose and you will be freed &#x2013; freed to live a life that is authentic, happy and meaningful.</p><h2>The Ocean Between Us</h2><p>The Ocean Between Us by Susan Wiggs released on Feb 22, 2005 is available now for purchase.</p><p>Susan Wiggs is the author of many beloved bestsellers, including the popular Lakeshore Chronicles series.

He ought to be in his rack and sleeping soundly. Instead, he sat with his feet propped on the edge of the workstation, hands clasped behind his head while he stared at a scenic Washington State calendar and thought about Grace.<br><br>He was ten thousand miles from home, on an aircraft carrier in the middle of an unofficial communications blackout instigated by Grace herself. His wife. The mother of his children. The woman who had not spoken to him willingly since he'd been deployed.<br><br>She had maintained radio silence like a wartime spy. He received official communiqu�s about the children, and sometimes the occasional report that made him regret giving her power of attorney. But never more than that.<br><br>The cruise was nearly over, and for the first time in his career Steve felt apprehensive about going home. He had no idea whether or not they could put their marriage back together again.<br><br>"Captain Bennett?" An administrative officer stood in the doorway with a clipboard in one hand and a PDA in the other.<br><br>"What is it, Lieutenant Killigrew?"<br><br>"Ms. Francine Atwater is here to see you, sir."<br><br>Bennett hid a frown. He'd nearly forgotten their appointment. In the belly of a carrier there was no day or night, just an unrelenting fluorescent sameness, stale recycled air and the constant thunder of flight ops rattling through the steel bones of the ship.<br><br>"Send her in." He unfolded his long frame and stood, assuming the stiff and wary posture schooled into him by twenty-six years in the Navy. Killigrew left for a moment, then returned with the reporter. Steve would have preferred to use the public affairs office on the 01 deck, but apparently Ms. Atwater was adamant about exploring every facet of carrier life. It was, after all, the era of the embedded reporter.<br><br>Francine Atwater. <em>Francine. </em>A member of the "new media," eager to take advantage of the military's newly relaxed information policy. According to his briefing notes, she had arrived COD&#x2014;carrier onboard delivery&#x2014;and intended to spend the next two weeks in this floating city with its own airport. Both the skipper of the <em>Dominion </em>and Captain Mason Crowther, Commander of the Air Group, had welcomed her personally, but they'd quickly handed her off to others, and now it was Steve's turn.<br><br>"Ms. Atwater, I'm Captain Steve Bennett, Deputy Commander of the Air Group." He tried not to stare, but she was the first civilian woman he'd seen in months. In a skirt, no less. He silently paid tribute to the genius who had invented nylon stockings and cherry-colored lipstick.<br><br>"Thank you, Captain Bennett." Her glossy lips parted in a smile. She was a charmer, all right, the way she tilted her head to one side and looked up at him through long eyelashes. Still, he detected shadows of fatigue under her carefully made-up eyes.<br><br>Newcomers to the carrier usually suffered seasickness and insomnia from all the noise.<br><br>"Welcome aboard, ma'am."<br><br>"I see you've been briefed about me," she said, indicating his notes from the PAO.<br><br>"Yes, ma'am."<br><br>"What a surprise. Everyone on this ship has. I swear, the U.S. Navy knows more about me than my own mother. My blood type, shoe size, visual acuity, sophomore-year biology grade&#x2014;"<br><br>"Standard procedure, ma'am." Even in lipstick and nylon stockings, the media held no appeal to the military. Still, he respected the way she stood her ground, especially while wearing three-inch heels. Civilians were advised on practical shipboard attire, but apparently no one had wanted Francine to change her shoes.<br><br>A tremendous whoosh, followed by a loud thump, rocked the ship. She staggered a little, and he put out a hand to steady her.<br><br>"Tell me I'll get used to that," she said.<br><br>"You'd better. We're launching and recovering planes around the clock, day and night. It's not going to stop." He slid open a desk drawer and took out a sealed plastic package. "Take these. I always keep plenty on hand."<br><br>"Earplugs?" She slipped the package into her briefcase. "Thanks."<br><br>He motioned her to a chair and she sat down, setting aside her bag. She took out a palm-size digital recorder, then swept the small space with a glance that shifted like a radar, homing in on the few personal items in evidence. "You have a beautiful family."<br><br>"Thank you, ma'am. I think so."<br><br>"How old are your children?"<br><br>"Brian and Emma are twins. They're seniors this year. Katie's in ninth grade. And that's Grace, my wife." A world of pain and hope underlay his words, but he prayed the reporter wouldn't notice. Every day he looked at that picture and tried to figure out what would fix this. He'd never deceived his wife before, so he didn't know how to undo the damage he'd caused. An ordinary husband would go home, take her out to dinner and say, "Look, honey. The truth is..." But Bennett couldn't do that from the middle of the ocean.<br><br>And sometimes he wondered if he even wanted to, damn it. He'd done his best to keep her from being hurt, but she didn't seem to appreciate that.<br><br>In the photo, taken at Mustang Island when they were stationed in Corpus Christi, the four of them were laughing into the camera, sunburned faces glowing.<br><br>"This is a great shot," said Ms. Atwater. "They look like the kind of people nothing bad ever happens to."<br><br>Interesting observation. He would have agreed with her, right up until this deployment. Grace and the kids were part of the all-American family, the kind you saw on minivan commercials or at summer baseball games.<br><br>"What's it like, being away from them for months on end?"<br><br>What the hell did she think it was like? A damned fraternity party?<br><br>"It's rough. I'm sure you'll hear that from a lot of the sailors on board. It's hard seeing your baby's first steps on videotape or getting a picture of a winning soccer goal by e-mail." Steve wished he had prepared himself better for her nosiness. He should have barricaded his private self. He was supposed to be good at that. According to Grace, he was the champ.<br><br>Atwater studied another photograph, this one in a slightly warped frame nearly twenty years old. "But the homecomings are sweet," she murmured, gazing down at the fading image.<br><br>He couldn't recall who had taken that shot, but he remembered the moment with painful clarity. It was the end of his first cruise after they'd married. The gray steel hull of an aircraft carrier reared in the background. Sailors, officers and civilians all crushed together, hugging with the desperate joy only military families understood. At the center, he and Grace held each other in an embrace he could still feel all these years later. He clasped her so close that her feet came off the ground, one of her dainty high heels dangling off a slender foot. He could still remember what she smelled like.<br><br>Since that photo was taken there had been dozens of other partings and reunions. He could picture each homecoming in succession&#x2014;Grace pregnant with the twins, no high heels that time, just sneakers that wouldn't lace up around her swollen feet. Then Grace pushing a double stroller that wouldn't fit through doorways. By then, her perfume was more likely to be a blend of baby wipes and cough drops. In later years, the kids kept her busy as she shuffled them between music lessons, sports practices, Brownies and Boy Scouts. But she always came to meet him. She never left him standing like some loser whose wife had given him the shaft while he was at sea, who would sling his seabag over his shoulder and pretend it didn't matter, whistling under his breath as he headed straight for the nearest bar.<br><br>Yesterday had been Grace's fortieth birthday. He'd phoned and gotten the machine. Lately she was so prickly about her age, anyway. She probably wouldn't thank him for the reminder.<br><br>Atwater asked about his background, his career path in the Navy, his role on the carrier. She listened well, occasionally making notes on a small yellow pad as well as recording him. At one point he glanced at his watch and was surprised to see how much time had passed. She'd talked to him about his family for nearly an hour. He wondered if he'd told her too much. Did the American people really need to know his life was coming undone like a slipknot?<br><br>He cleared his throat. "Says on my agenda that I'm your tour guide for nighttime flight ops." He was surprised that she'd gained authorization to be on the flight deck at night, but apparently her project was important to Higher Authority.<br><br>"I've been looking forward to this, sir." She came alive in that special way of people who were in love with flying, the more high-tech and dangerous, the better. And there was no form of flying more dangerous than carrier operations.<br><br>He was dog tired, but he put on a smile because, in spite of everything, he shared her enthusiasm.<br><br>"I thought about going into the service and learning to fly," she said, her eyes shining. "Couldn't make the commitment, though."<br><br>"Lots of people can't." He said it without condemnation or pride. It was a plain fact. The U.S. Navy demanded half of your life. It was as simple as that. He'd been in the Navy since his eighteenth birthday. And of his twenty-six years of service, he'd been at sea for half of them. That kind of commitment had its rewards, but it also carried a price. He was finally figuring that out.<br><br>As he went to the door, the Inbox on his computer screen blinked, but he didn't check to see what had come in. If it was personal, he didn't want a reporter reading over his shoulder.<br><br>He led her single file down a narrow passageway tiled in blue, narrating their journey and cautioning her to avoid slamming her shins on the "knee knockers," structural members at the bottom of each hatch. Lining theP-way were dozens of red cabinets containing fire-control gear and protective clothing. The least little spark could take out half the ship if it happened to ignite in the wrong place.<br><br>Steve spoke over his shoulder, but he wasn't sure how much she was taking in. The constant din of flight ops intruded&#x2014;roaring engines, the hiss and grind of the power plant and arresting gear, the whistle and screech of aircraft slamming on deck&#x2014;drowning out normal conversation. In the enlisted men's mess, they created a small stir. Sailors enjoying MIDRATS&#x2014;rations for personnel on night duty&#x2014;stopped what they were doing the minute they saw Francine Atwater. Their jaws dropped as though unhinged. Even the female sailors stared, not with the raw yearning of the males but with wistfulness, and perhaps a flicker of disdain. In the service of their country, they had learned to do without makeup, without hair spray, without vanity.<br><br>As they climbed an open steel ladder, Atwater took it in stride, but she was probably wishing she'd worn pants and thick-soled boots. They crossed the hangar bay, where aircraft waited with wings folded like origami cranes.<br><br>In the passageway under flight-deck control, the roar of aircraft pounding the steel deck was louder still. "We need to gear up," Steve said, handing her a flight suit and boots.<br><br>"I've been briefed on safety procedures." She sat down and slipped off her civilian shoes, flashing a slim foot encased in a nylon stocking. "Hours and hours of briefing."<br><br>"The Navy loves to brief people," he admitted, hearing echoes of the endless droning of Navy gouge he'd endured over the years, litanies of instruction and advisories. "In this case, I hope you listened," he added. Then, assuming she hadn't, he reiterated the list of hazards on the flight deck. A sailor could be sucked into an engine intake. Exhaust from a jet engine had the power to blast a person across the deck, or even overboard. He'd seen large men bouncing like basketballs all the way to the deck edge. Or an arresting wire might snap as a tail hook grabbed it, whipping with enough force to sever a person's legs. Taxiing planes, scurrying yellow tractors, breaking launch bars&#x2014;all were hazards waiting to happen.<br><br>His hand wandered to his throat in a habitual gesture, seeking his St. Christopher medal. Then he remembered that he'd lost it, the good-luck charm he'd had since his first deployment. He never went to sea without it. Ah, hell. At least he wasn't flying.<br><br>He distracted himself by perusing the bulletin board of one of the squadrons. The postings included items for sale or trade, a movie schedule and an invitation to the upcoming Steel Beach picnic, during which a dozen or so garage bands would perform. Personnel on board were desperate to create a normal existence in a highly abnormal situation.<br><br>It didn't always work, Steve thought.<br><br>After she finished gearing up for flight ops, Francine Atwater looked totally different. Steel-toed boots, a shiny gray-green jumpsuit and a white visitor's jersey hid all of her charms except those big brown eyes.<br><br>Feeling a bit like an airline flight attendant, he showed her how to operate her float coat. The vest was equipped with a beacon light, a packet of chemical dye to mark the water if she found herself in the drink, a flare, a whistle. "This is your MOBI," he said. It was a transmitter the size of a cell phone, with a whip antenna connected to a small box.<br><br>"Let me guess. Man Overboard...Indicator."<br><br>"You did your homework."<br><br>"I told you, I was briefed. But you're forgetting something," she said.<br><br>"What's that?"<br><br>"I don't intend to go for a midnight swim."<br><br>"Then we're on the same page." He slipped the device into the dye pouch of her float coat and closed the Velcro fastening. "But just in case, the transmitter has its own unique identification. That way, the bridge will know identity and location immediately."<br><br>"So this one has my name on it?"<br><br>"Just the number of the float coat. You want me to show you how to fasten everything?"<br><br>"I've got it," she said.<br><br>He showed her a status board outlining the night's exercises. The list indicated who was taking off, who was landing, who the crew members were, the purpose of their particular operation.<br><br>"Two of the names are in red," Atwater pointed out. "Is that significant?"<br><br>"They're nugget pilots. New guys. This is their first cruise."<br><br>"Lieutenant junior grade Joshua Lamont," she read from the chart. "Call sign Lamb."<br><br>Steve didn't move a muscle, even though the sound of Lamont's name was a punch in the gut. He wondered if he would ever get used to having Lamont under his command. A C-2 Greyhound transport plane had flown the young pilot aboard as a replacement pilot. Lamont was a member of the Sparhawks, the carrier's squadron of EA-6B Prowlers. The reporter probably thought his call sign was sweet, but Steve knew it came from an incident during training in Nevada&#x2014;Little Angry Man Boy.<br><br></p><h2>The Truth According to Us: A Novel</h2><p><b><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER<i>&nbsp;�&nbsp;</i></b>From the co-author of <i>The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society </i>comes a wise, witty, and exuberant novel, perfect for fans of Lee Smith, that illuminates the power of loyalty and forgiveness, memory and truth, and the courage it takes to do what&#x2019;s right.&nbsp; </b><br><br> Annie Barrows once again evokes the charm and eccentricity of a small town filled with extraordinary characters.

In school, we commemorated the occasion as we commemorated most occasions, with tableaux, one for each of the major events in Macedonia&#x2019;s history. There weren&#x2019;t many, hardly enough to stretch out across eight grades, but the teachers eked them out the best they could. If it hadn&#x2019;t been for the War Between the States, I don&#x2019;t know what they would have done. When Virginia seceded from the Union, western Virginia got mad and seceded right back into it, all except four little counties, one of them ours, that stuck out their tongues at West Virginia and declared themselves part of the Confederacy, a piece of sass with long consequences in the way of road-paving and school desks.<br><br>Tucked up in a crook between the Potomac and the Shenandoah, Macedonia was a junction for generals and railroads alike, and by the time Lee hung up his sword at Appomattox, the town had changed hands forty-seven times, six of them in one day. Our teachers dearly loved to get up a scene of the townspeople stuffing their Confederate flags up the chimney as the Union troops marched in and yanking them back down again as the troops departed. The fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-graders got the war scenes, and the seventh- and eighth-graders got the short end of the stick, because not a thing happened in Macedonia after 1865, except the roundhouse blowing up and the American Everlasting Hosiery Company opening its doors. Half the town worked in that mill and the other half wished it did, but there was not much about the American Everlasting Hosiery Company that looked good in a tableau. Sometimes the teachers gave up and killed two birds with one stone by making the seventh-graders march across the stage, waving socks, while the eighth-graders sang &#x201c;The Star-Spangled Banner&#x201d; behind them. In 1938, though, the eighth grade hit pay dirt, because Mrs. Roosevelt drove through town. She stopped at the square, took a drink from our sulfur-spring water fountain, made a face, and drove away. That was plenty for a tableau, except that instead of making a face, the eighth-grade Mrs. Roosevelt said, &#x201c;The people of Macedonia are lucky to receive the benefits of healthful mineral water.&#x201d; My sister Bird and I laughed so hard we got sent into the hall.<br><br>Once the curtain had clunked down on our tableaux and we&#x2019;d been herded back into our classrooms, I supposed that Macedonia&#x2019;s sesquicentennial festivities were concluded. Hadn&#x2019;t we just covered one hundred and fifty years of history in twenty-three minutes flat? We had. But not a week later came the Decoration Day parade, and that, I realized later, was the real beginning of the sesquicentennial. Later still, I realized that everything began that day. Everything that was to heave itself free of its foundations over the course of the summer began to rattle lightly on the morning of the parade. That was when I first heard of Layla Beck, when I began to wonder about my father, and when I noticed I was being lied to and decided to leave my childhood behind. I have since wondered, of course, how my life&#x2014;and my father&#x2019;s and my aunt Jottie&#x2019;s, too&#x2014;would have been different if I&#x2019;d decided to stay at home that morning. This is what&#x2019;s called the enigma of history, and it can drive you out of your mind if you let it.<br><br>Jottie and I were packed tight on the sidewalk, together with everyone else in town, to watch the parade. Usually it wasn&#x2019;t much, the Decoration Day parade, just a matter of assorted veterans looking grim and the high school marching band. But this year, in honor of the sesquicentennial, we&#x2019;d been promised an extra-fancy show, a real spectacle. And that was what we got: The United Daughters of the Confederacy flounced out first, with the Ladies of the Grand Army of the Republic hot on their heels. Then the Rotary band struck up with patriotic tunes, which was a lot to manage on four trumpets and had a terrible effect on the pony brigade. The veterans marched along, a pair of girls in skimpy outfits flung batons in the air, just exactly like a movie parade, except that only one of them could catch. We even had a float, The Apple Princess and Her Blossoms, smiling on the back of a truck. Out came the mayor, waving from his big green car, and behind him was Mr. Parker Davies, who had got himself up in a sword and knee pants to look like General Magnus Hamilton, the founder of Macedonia, which put me in mind of a question I had always wanted to ask. I nudged my aunt Jottie. &#x201c;How come he called it Macedonia?&#x201d;<br><br>She tilted her dark eyes down to mine. &#x201c;The General was a great admirer of the Macedonian virtues.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Huh.&#x201d; That was news to me. &#x201c;What are they, the Macedonian virtues?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say huh. Ferocity and devotion.&#x201d; The Apple Princess joggled by. It was Elsie Averill in a white dress. A lady standing just behind me leaned forward for a better look, and a big whiff of Jungle Gardenia went up my nose. <br><br>I squeezed closer to Jottie. &#x201c;Did he have them?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>Jottie&#x2019;s eyes followed Elsie for a bit. &#x201c;Did he have what?&#x201d; she murmured.<br><br>&#x201c;Jottie!&#x201d; I recalled her. &#x201c;Did General Hamilton have the Macedonian virtues?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The General?&#x201d; She lifted one eyebrow. &#x201c;The General once chopped off a soldier&#x2019;s toes to keep the poor man from deserting. You tell me, Willa: Is that ferocity, devotion, or just plain crazy?&#x201d;<br><br>I eyed Mr. Parker Davies, imagining his bloodied sword raised high, a little toe speared on the point. That was ferocity, I was pretty sure. &#x201c;Do I have them?&#x201d; I asked hopefully.<br><br>Jottie smiled. &#x201c;Ferocity and devotion? You want those?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re virtues, aren&#x2019;t they?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;They surely are. Ferocity, devotion, and a nickel will get you a cup of coffee at the Pickus Caf�.&#x201d; I made a face at her, and she laughed. The parade passed by, turned around on itself, and straggled back up Prince Street.<br><br>I thought maybe I had a chance at devotion.<br><br>Now the Macedonia Chamber of Commerce made the turn and marched by, eight men in identical tan hats and overcoats. They looked like a set of matching boy dolls, only embarrassed. Jottie chuckled and flapped her little flag. &#x201c;Hooray!&#x201d; she cheered. &#x201c;Hooray for our brave boys in the Chamber of Commerce!&#x201d;<br><br>They pretended they didn&#x2019;t hear, all except one. &#x201c;Jottie?&#x201d; he said, swiveling around. Jottie drew in a sharp breath, and I saw two spots of pink appear on her cheeks. She started to put up her hand, let it drop, and then changed her mind and lifted it in a little wave. That set him up; now he started smiling like crazy, and even though the parade was moving again, he called out to her, &#x201c;I was hoping I might see you today, Jottie, I was thinking I might&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>A man behind bumped into him then, and he had to walk on, but he kept turning around to wave at her as he went. <br><br>&#x201c;Who was that?&#x201d; I asked. Nothing happened, so I gave her a poke. &#x201c;Who was that, Jottie?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sol,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Sol McKubin.&#x201d; She opened her purse and rummaged inside. &#x201c;I had a handkerchief in here this morning.&#x201d;<br><br>And that would have been that, if I hadn&#x2019;t heard a low laugh behind me. It was Mrs. Jungle Gardenia. &#x201c;Shoo-oo, good thing old Felix ain&#x2019;t here,&#x201d; she hooted softly to herself.<br><br>What? I whirled around, wondering who she was and how she knew my father.<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t look like someone he would know. She was wearing a young lady&#x2019;s dress, even though she wasn&#x2019;t a young lady, and her face was white with powder. She caught my stare and wiggled her drawn-on eyebrows at me. I turned back to Jottie quick.<br><br>&#x201c;Jottie,&#x201d; I said, giving her another poke. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s Sol McKubin?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is that Miss Kissining there across the street?&#x201d; Jottie squinted at the sidewalk opposite. &#x201c;In that polka-dot dress?&#x201d;<br><br>I looked. It wasn&#x2019;t any more Miss Kissining than it was the Lindbergh baby. &#x201c;You must be going blind, Jottie,&#x201d; I began scornfully, but I was drowned out by the Rotary band giving their final honk on &#x201c;The Battle Hymn of the Republic.&#x201d; The parade was over.<br><br>That was all right with me. My favorite part came after, anyway. I took hold of Jottie&#x2019;s hand, and we sailed out into the wake of the marchers.<br><br>It was like a second parade, with all of Macedonia milling along Prince Street, busying themselves with the real entertainment of the day: calling out, stopping to chat, and gathering into little knots to deliver up their opinions about the ponies, the batons, the float, and the mayor&#x2019;s car. I dearly loved to walk down a street with my aunt Jottie. When I went alone, I was a child, and grown-ups ignored me accordingly. Sometimes, of course, they&#x2019;d stop me to offer improving advice like Tie your shoelaces before you trip and knock out those teeth of yours, but for the most part, I was a worm in mud. Beneath notice, as they say in books. When I walked with Jottie, it was a different matter. Grown-ups greeted me politely, and that was nice. That was real pleasant. But the best thing, the very best thing about walking through town with my arm through Jottie&#x2019;s was listening to her recount the secret history of every man, woman, dog, and flower bed we passed, sideways out of the corner of her mouth so that only I could hear. Those were moments of purest satisfaction to me. Why? Because when she told me those secrets, Jottie made me something better than just a temporary grown-up. She made me her confidante.<br><br>We were strolling up the street when we came upon Mr. Tare Russell in his bath chair. He wasn&#x2019;t real old, Mr. Russell, but there was something the matter with him, and he had to be rolled around town with a blanket over his knees. When he saw us, he yelped, &#x201c;Jottie Romeyn, you just come over here and let me feast my eyes on you!&#x201d; Then he waggled his fingers so that his Negro servant would push the bath chair faster. It didn&#x2019;t seem right; that poor man looked a lot older and feebler than Mr. Russell.<br><br>&#x201c;Tare!&#x201d; said Jottie. &#x201c;What brings you here? I&#x2019;ve never known you to come to the parade before!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Civic duty,&#x201d; said Mr. Russell. &#x201c;What kind of a person would miss Macedonia&#x2019;s sesquicentennial parade?&#x201d;<br><br>Jottie grinned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been asking myself that very question, Tare, all morning long. How&#x2019;d you like The Apple Princess and Her Blossoms?&#x201d;<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t answer. In fact, he almost interrupted her, he spoke so quick. &#x201c;I thought Felix would be marching with the veterans. But he wasn&#x2019;t. I didn&#x2019;t see him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Felix is away on business,&#x201d; said Jottie.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s been gone all week,&#x201d; I added helpfully.<br><br>&#x201c;Business,&#x201d; repeated Mr. Russell, bunching up his mouth. &#x201c;Well. Felix works like an old mule, doesn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d; Suddenly, he swung around and glared at me. &#x201c;Tell him, when he comes back, not to forget old friends. You just tell your daddy that, would you?&#x201d; he snapped.<br><br>I took a step backward. &#x201c;Yessir.&#x201d;<br><br>Jottie&#x2019;s little hand closed around mine. &#x201c;Of course we will!&#x201d; she said cheerily. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll tell Felix first thing!&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. Russell waggled his fingers again. &#x201c;Take me on home,&#x201d; he barked to his old Negro servant. &#x201c;You trying to fry me like an egg?&#x201d;<br><br>We watched him go, and Jottie&#x2019;s hand squeezed mine. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go window-shopping,&#x201d; she suggested. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s pretend we&#x2019;ve each got ten dollars, and we have to spend it this afternoon or we&#x2019;ll lose it all.&#x201d;<br><br>So we did, and we were wrangling away about whether I could borrow two of her imaginary dollars for a pink silk dress, when we ran up against Marjorie Lanz. She lived down the street from us, and she talked all the time. She started up before we could even see her. &#x201c;How-you, Jottie?&#x201d; she shouted from inside Vogel&#x2019;s Shoes. &#x201c;Look here at these sandals.&#x201d; She came out, holding a big yellow shoe. &#x201c;How&#x2019;d you like the parade, I thought Elsie looked real pretty, the Rotary could use some new blood, don&#x2019;t you think? Where&#x2019;s Mae and Minerva? Oh hi, honey,&#x201d; she said, catching sight of me. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you just cute as a button?&#x201d;<br><br>I was too old to be cute as a button, but I nodded, being polite.<br><br>Now she was swinging the shoe back and forth. Mr. Vogel was standing nervously in his doorway, waiting to grab her if she walked away with his sandal. Marjorie gabbled on, &#x201c;I heard you&#x2019;re getting yourself a new boarder, Jottie, that&#x2019;s nice, with all those extra rooms you got.&#x201d; I shot a look at Jottie. First I&#x2019;d heard of any new boarder. &#x201c;Who-all you going to get, Jottie? Hope it&#x2019;s someone with more starch in him than Tremendous Wilson, I don&#x2019;t know how you stood that man, is it someone nice?&#x201d; She paused and looked at Jottie expectantly. So did Mr. Vogel. So did I.<br><br>Jottie gazed at Marjorie Lanz for a moment, and then she leaned close. &#x201c;My new boarder is a representative of the United States government,&#x201d; she murmured. She looked suspiciously at Mr. Vogel. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all I can say.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ooooh.&#x201d; Marjorie clutched the sandal tight. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a secret?&#x201d;<br><br>Jottie nodded regretfully, like she wished she could tell more, and turned toward Mr. Vogel. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a nice sandal you have there, Mr. Vogel. Does it come in blue?&#x201d; He shook his head no. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s too bad. Well, Marjorie, Willa and I had better be getting along. We have to clean out that new boarder&#x2019;s room. The United States government doesn&#x2019;t like a lot of clutter.&#x201d; She looked at me. &#x201c;They like it neat as a pin. Don&#x2019;t they, Willa?&#x201d; <br><br>Out of pure loyalty, I nodded, and then I waited until we were three storefronts away from Vogel&#x2019;s Shoes before I asked, &#x201c;Are we really getting a new boarder?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; said Jottie.<br><br>&#x201c;Is he really part of the government?&#x201d;<br><br>She smiled. &#x201c;No. &#x2019;Cause it&#x2019;s not a he.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A lady?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. A lady.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A lady in the government?&#x201d;<br><br>Jottie raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;Sounds like you don&#x2019;t believe a word I said.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do,&#x201d; I said slowly. &#x201c;But how come I didn&#x2019;t know about it?&#x201d;<br><br>She reached out to brush my hair away from my face. &#x201c;I thought you did know. Didn&#x2019;t you see me move all those things out of the closet? You were sitting right there on the bed.&#x201d;<br><br>I tried to remember but I couldn&#x2019;t.

He and his family live near New Haven, Connecticut.<b>Chapter One: Shortcut</b><br><br>(I)<br><br>On Friday the cat disappeared, the White House phoned, and Jeannie&#x2019;s fever&#x2014;said the sitter when Julia called from the echoing marble lobby of Lombard Hall, where she and her husband were f�ting shadowy alumni, one or two facing indictment, whose only virtue was piles of money&#x2014;hit 103. After that, things got worser faster, as her grandmother used to say, although Granny Vee&#x2019;s Harlem locutions, shaped to the rhythm of an era when the race possessed a stylish sense of humor about itself, would not have gone over well in the Landing, and Julia Carlyle had long schooled herself to avoid them.<br><br>The cat was the smallest problem, even if later it turned out to be a portent. Rainbow Coalition, the children&#x2019;s smelly feline mutt, had vanished before and usually came back, but now and then stayed away and was dutifully replaced by another dreadful creature of the same name. The White House was another matter. Lemaster&#x2019;s college roommate, now residing in the Oval Office, telephoned at least once a month, usually to shoot the breeze, a thing it had never before occurred to Julia that Presidents of the United States did. As to Jeannie, well, the child was a solid eight years into a feverish childhood, the youngest of four, and her mother knew by now not to rush home at each spike of the thermometer. Tylenol and cool compresses had so far defeated every virus that had dared attack her child and would stymie this one, too. Julia gave the sitter her marching orders and returned to the endless dinner in time for Lemaster&#x2019;s closing jokes. It was eleven minutes before ten on the second Friday in November in the year of our Lord 2003. Outside Lombard Hall, the snow had arrived early, two inches on the ground and more expected. As the police later would reconstruct the night&#x2019;s events, Professor Kellen Zant was already dead and on the way to town in his car.<br><br>(II)<br><br>After. Big cushy flakes still falling. Julia and Lemaster were barreling along Four Mile Road in their Cadillac Escalade with all the extras, color regulation black, as befitted their role as the most celebrated couple in African America&#x2019;s lonely Harbor County outpost. That, at least, was how Julia saw them, even after the family&#x2019;s move six years ago out into what clever Lemaster called &#x201c;the heart of whiteness.&#x201d; For most of their marriage they had lived in Elm Harbor, largest city in the county and home of the university her husband now led. By now they should have moved back, but the drafty old mansion the school set aside for its president was undergoing renovation, a firm condition Lemaster had placed on his acceptance of the post. The trustees had worried about how it would look to spend so much on a residence at a time when funds to fix the classrooms were difficult to raise, but Lemaster, as always with his public, had been at once reasonable and adamant. &#x201c;People value you more,&#x201d; he had explained to his wife, &#x201c;if it costs more to get you than they expected.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Or they hate you for it,&#x201d; Julia had objected, but Lemaster stood his ground; for, within the family, he was a typical West Indian male, and therefore merely adamant.<br><br>They drove. Huge flakes swirled toward the windshield, the soft, chunky variety that signals to any New Englander that the storm is moving slowly and the eye is yet to come. Julia sulked against the dark leather, steaming with embarrassment, having called two of the alums by each other&#x2019;s names, and having referred half the night to a wife named Carlotta as Charlotte, who then encouraged her, in that rich Yankee way, not to worry about it, dear, it&#x2019;s a common mistake. Lemaster, who had never forgotten a name in his life, charmed everybody into smiling, but as anyone who has tried to raise money from the wealthy knows, a tiny sliver of offense can cut a potential gift by half or more, and in this crowd, half might mean eight figures.<br><br>Julia said, &#x201c;Vanessa&#x2019;s not setting fires any more.&#x201d; Vanessa, a high-school senior, being the second of their four children. The first and the third&#x2014;their two boys&#x2014;were both away at school.<br><br>Her husband said, &#x201c;Thank you for tonight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did you hear what I said?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I did, my love.&#x201d; The words rapid and skeptical, rich with that teasing, not-quite-British lilt. &#x201c;Did you hear what I said?&#x201d; Turning lightly but swiftly to avoid a darting animal. &#x201c;I know you hate these things. I promise to burden you with as few as possible.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Lemmie, come on. I was awful. You&#x2019;ll raise more money if you leave me behind.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wrong, Jules. Cameron Knowland told me he so enjoyed your company that he&#x2019;s upping his pledge by five million.&#x201d;<br><br>Julia in one of her moods, reassurance the last thing she craved. Clever wind whipped the snow into concentric circles of whiteness in the headlights, creating the illusion that the massive car was being drawn downward into a funnel. Four Mile Road was not the quickest route home from the city, but the Carlyles were planning a detour to the multiplex to pick up their second child, out for the first time in a while with her boyfriend, &#x201c;That Casey,&#x201d; as Lemaster called him. The GPS screen on the dashboard showed them well off the road, meaning the computer had never heard of Four Mile, which did not, officially, exist. But Lemaster would not forsake a beloved shortcut, even in a storm, and unmapped country lanes were his favorite.<br><br>&#x201c;Cameron Knowland,&#x201d; Julia said distinctly, &#x201c;is a pig.&#x201d; Her husband waited. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad the SEC people are after him. I hope he goes to jail.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t Cameron, Jules, it&#x2019;s his company.&#x201d; Lemaster&#x2019;s favorite tone of light, donnish correction, which she had once, long ago, loved. &#x201c;The most that would be imposed is a civil fine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All I know is, he kept looking down my dress.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You should have slapped his face.&#x201d; She turned in surprise, and what felt distantly like gratitude. Lemaster laughed. &#x201c;Cameron would have taken his pledge back, but Carlotta would have doubled it.&#x201d;<br><br>A brief marital silence, Julia painfully aware that tonight she had entirely misplaced the delicate, not-quite-flirty insouciance that had made her, a quarter-century ago, the most popular girl at her New Hampshire high school. Like her husband, she was of something less than average height. Her skin was many shades lighter than his blue-black, for her unknown father had been, as Lemaster insisted on calling him, a Caucasian. Her gray eyes were strangely large for a woman of her diminutive stature. Her slightly jutting jaw was softened by an endearing dimple. Her lips were alluringly crooked. When she smiled, the left side of her wide mouth rose a little farther than the right, a signal, her husband liked to say, of her quietly liberal politics. She was by reputation an easy person to like. But there were days when it all felt false, and forced. Being around the campus did that to her. She had been a deputy dean of the divinity school for almost three years before Lemaster was brought back from Washington to run the university, and her husband&#x2019;s ascension had somehow increased her sense of not belonging. Julia and the children had remained in the Landing during her husband&#x2019;s year and a half as White House counsel. Lemaster had spent as many weekends as he could at home. People invented delicious rumors to explain his absence, none of them true, but as Granny Vee used to say, the truth only matters if you want it to.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re so silly,&#x201d; she said, although, to her frequent distress, her husband was anything but. She looked out the window. Slickly whitened trees slipped past, mostly conifers. It was early for snow, not yet winter, not yet anything, really: that long season of pre-Thanksgiving New England chill when the stores declared it Christmas season but everybody else only knew it was cold. Julia had spent most of her childhood in Hanover, New Hampshire, where her mother had been a professor at Dartmouth, and she was accustomed to early snow, but this was ridiculous. She said, &#x201c;Can we talk about Vanessa?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The fires. It&#x2019;s all over with, Lemmie.&#x201d;<br><br>A pause. Lemaster played with the satellite radio, switching, without asking, from her adored Broadway show tunes&#x2014;Granny Vee had loved them, so she did, too&#x2014;to his own secret passion, the more rebellious and edgy and less commercial end of the hip-hop spectrum. The screen informed her in glowing green letters that the furious sexual bombast now assaulting her eardrums from nine speakers was something called Goodie Mobb. &#x201c;How do you know it&#x2019;s over?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, for one thing, she hasn&#x2019;t done it in a year. For another, Dr. Brady says so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nine months,&#x201d; said Lemaster, precisely. &#x201c;And she&#x2019;s not Vincent Brady&#x2019;s daughter,&#x201d; he added, slender fingers tightening ever so slightly on the wheel, but in caution, not anger, for the weather had slipped from abhorrent to atrocious. She glanced his way, turning down the throbbing music just in case, for a change, he wanted to talk, but he was craning forward, hoping for a better view, heavy flakes now falling faster than the wipers could clean. He wore glasses with steel rims. His goatee and mustache were so perfectly trimmed they might have been invisible against his smooth ebon flesh, except for the thousand flecks of gray that reshaped to follow the motion of his jaw whenever he spoke. &#x201c;What a mistake,&#x201d; said Lemaster, but it took Julia a second to work out that he was referring to the psychiatrist, and not one among the many enemies he had effortlessly, and surprisingly, collected during his six months as head of the univer...</p><h2>A Lion in Paris</h2><p><i>A Lion in Paris</i> is widely regarded as the most accomplished book by multi-award-winning children&#x2019;s author/illustrator Beatrice Alemagna.

He arrives at a Paris train station, expecting to be met with fear and even violence, but instead he is virtually ignored: "More than anything, the lion liked to be noticed." After some existential sadness in the rain, he starts to enjoy the sights of the city. Finally, he discovers an empty plinth at a crossroads, climbs up on it, and decides to stay there and become a Parisian landmark. There are only one or two short sentences per page, and there is little continuity from one spread to the next, making the story seem disjointed. The mixed-media illustrations include photographs, detailed drawings, and loosely sketched figures that play with scale to create a surreal world with a beige and orange color scheme. Perspective is flattened, causing objects to appear piled on top of one another. The pages are meant to be turned upward like a wall calendar, making it best for one-on-one reading, especially because of the large trim size. This story about finding where you are appreciated in the world will be more at home on coffee tables and in museum gift shops than at bedtime.&#x2014;Anna Haase Krueger, Ramsey County Library, MN</p><h2>Tin Can Titans: The Heroic Men and Ships of World War II&#39;s Most Decorated Navy Destroyer Squadron</h2><p><b>An epic narrative of World War II naval action that brings to life the sailors and exploits of the war's most decorated destroyer squadron</b><br><br>When Admiral William Halsey selected Destroyer Squadron 21 (Desron 21) to lead his victorious ships into Tokyo Bay to accept the Japanese surrender, it was the most battle-hardened US naval squadron of the war.<br><br>But it was not the squadron of ships that had accumulated such an inspiring resume; it was the people serving aboard them. Sailors, not metallic superstructures and hulls, had won the battles and become the stuff of legend. Men like Commander Donald MacDonald, skipper of the USS <i>O'Bannon</i>, who became the most decorated naval officer of the Pacific war; Lieutenant Hugh Barr Miller, who survived his ship's sinking and waged a one-man battle against the enemy while stranded on a Japanese-occupied island; and Doctor Dow "Doc" Ransom, the beloved physician of the USS <i>La Vallette</i>, who combined a mixture of humor and medical expertise to treat his patients at sea, epitomize the sacrifices made by all the men and women of World War II.<br><br>Through diaries, personal interviews with survivors, and letters written to and by the crews during the war, preeminent historian of the Pacific theater John Wukovits brings to life the human story of the squadron and its men who bested the Japanese in the Pacific and helped take the war to Tokyo.<br></p><p><b>John Wukovits</b> is a military expert specializing in the Pacific theater of World War II.

Fintan Dunne, the P.I. lured into the case and coerced by conscience into unraveling the complex setup that has put an innocent man on death row, will soon find this to be a murder with tentacles that stretch far beyond the crime scene - to Nazi Germany, in fact. Following it to the end leads him into a murderous conspiracy of a scope that defies imagination. Grim clouds are roiling over Berlin; plans for a coup are forming among a cadre of Wehrmacht officers in Berlin. Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, head of Military Intelligence, is gripped by paralysis over the choice he must make: join the plotters in treason and violate every value he holds as an officer, or betray them to the Gestapo and forsake the country&#39;s last hope to avert utter destruction and centuries of shame. With no limits to Hitler&#39;s manic pursuit of territorial expansion, with crimes against his people lauded as a program of racial cleansing at the vanguard of the &#34;scientific&#34; eugenics movement launched in America and Britain, the &#34;hour of the cat&#34; looms when every German must make a choice. When Canaris recieves an order to assist in a sinister covert operation on foreign shores, his hour has come.

This revised and expanded version of the original guide published in 1981 is written to address the concern that many Christians, entrusted with the gospel message, have forgotten the message and their responsibility to accurately convey it. The recovery of a God-centered and grace-centered gospel is imperative, says Will Metzger. In the third edition of his critically-acclaimed training manual he expands on the topics of grace and worship. And he emphasizes the centrality of sovereign, saving grace that completely exalts God. In addition, he offers a narrative approach to witnessing with the story "Come Home," training materials for Christians who want to learn God-centered evangelism, and a study guide on evangelism suitable for individuals or groups. More than ever, <em>Tell the Truth</em> is ready to serve the church as a comprehensive, accessible and effective guide to God-centered evangelism.</p><p>Metzger has been a campus minister at the University of Delaware since 1965, where he serves with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship and Christian InterAction (a church and campus connection). His evangelism ministry has taken him to every continent, and he has witnessed to people from varied nationalities both on campus and through a church that he pastored."Carl F.H. Henry, lamenting the wedge that is sometimes driven between theology and evangelism, said to the World Congress on Evangelism in Berlin in 1966, 'In these next years we must strive harder to become theologian-evangelists, rather than to remain content as just theologians or just evangelists.'<br> <br> "I am delighted that Will Metzger is a theologian-evangelist. His book, <em>Tell the Truth,</em> has long been a personal favorite of mine and required reading in my evangelism classes. Metzger cuts through much of the theological confusion surrounding evangelism and the gospel message and sets forth biblical and practical wisdom in an easily understood and applied manner.<br> <br> "I am delighted he has revised and updated this significant work and commend it to you as essential reading for anyone involved in evangelism." (Timothy Beougher, Ph.D., Billy Graham Professor of Evangelism and associate dean of the Billy Graham School of Missions, Evangelism and Church Growth, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville, Kentucky)<br><br>"Christianity is for sharing, and Christians who love their neighbor want to do that persuasively. Pizzazz-free and nonmanipulative, Metzger's training manual on helping people to care about truth and face the truth about Jesus is first class of its kind." (J. I. Packer, Board of Governors Professor of Theology, Regent College, and author of Knowing God)<br><br>On the 2nd edition: "We recommend it to everyone who asks for practical help in personal evangelism." (Dr. John MacArthur Jr., senior pastor, Grace Community Church, Sun Valley, California)<br><br>"This is one of the best and most useful books on evangelism for ordinary Christians. Will Metzger has drawn upon a lifetime of personal ministry to write a biblically based, theologically sound, practically relevant book on how to share the gospel. <em>Tell the Truth</em> will help you--yes, even you!--learn how to develop an evangelistic way of life. Instead of relying on manipulative, man-centered methods of evangelism, Metzger explains how to introduce people to Jesus Christ in a way that glorifies God." (Philip Graham Ryken, senior minister, Tenth Presbyterian Church)<br><br>"This new edition has made a good book even better. You must have it!" (Rev. Ernie Reisinger, Southern Baptist pastor, evangelist and author)<br><br>"An outstanding tool for those who long to reach their campus or community with the gospel of grace." (Dr. David G. Sinclair Sr., former campus minister and senior pastor)<br><br>"Will Metzger writes <em>Tell the Truth</em> for a reformation of personal evangelism. He laments the evangelism that encourages nice people to be nice to others, in the hope that they will be nice to God. Such nice, uncoverted 'Christians' have lost the gospel. This probing book presents the key to evangelism in the power of grace, the sovereign grace of the gospel. Salvation is the Lord's work, accomplished by his Spirit for his glory. Awe, freedom and delight in the Lord are its fruit." (Dr. Edmund P. Clowney, author, former president, Westminster Theological Seminary (PA))<br><br>"A very good book just got better. Twenty years ago <em>Tell the Truth</em> moved us so deeply that we brought Will Metzger to our church for a seminar on glad-hearted, God-centered evangelism. Now updated and with powerful new sections on sovereign grace and whole-souled worship, this book soars with a fresh passion for the supremacy of God in truth-driven evangelism. May God use it to move thousands to make much of Christ among the perishing."

The two major foreign policy crises in this book, one successfully negotiated, one that ended tragically, were unique in that they moved so fast that much of the work on them had to be handled by telephone. The longer of the two sections deals in detail with the Yom Kippur War and is full of revelations, as well as great relevancy: In Kissinger&#39;s conversations with Golda Meir, Israeli Prime Minister; Simcha Dinitz, Israeli ambassador to the U.S.; Mohamed el-Zayyat, the Egyptian Foreign Minister; Anatoly Dobrynin, the Soviet Ambassador to the U.S.; Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary General of the U.N.; and a host of others, as well as with President Nixon, many of the main elements of the current problems in the Middle East can be seen. The section on the end of the Vietnam War is a tragic drama, as Kissinger tries to help his president and a divided nation through the final moments of a lost war. It is full of astonishing material, such as Kissinger&#39;s trying to secure the evacuation of a Marine company which, at the very last minute, is discovered to still be in Saigon as the city is about to fall, and his exchanges with Ambassador Martin in Saigon, who is reluctant to leave his embassy. This is a book that presents perhaps the best record of the inner workings of diplomacy at the superheated pace and tension of real crisis.</p><p><b>Henry Kissinger</b> received the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Medal of Liberty, among other awards.

Many people who suffer from sugar sensitivity don't even know it&#x2014;and they continue to consume large quantities of sweets, breads, pasta, or alcohol. These foods can trigger exhaustion or low self-esteem, yet their biochemical impact makes those who are sugar sensitive crave them even more. This vicious cycle can continue for years, leaving sufferers overweight, fatigued, depressed, and sometimes alcoholic.<br> <br>Dr. Kathleen DesMaisons came up with the solution and published it in her revolutionary book Potatoes Not Prozac. It gave you the tools needed to overcome sugar dependency, including self-tests and a step-by-step, drug-free program with a customizable diet designed to change your brain chemistry. But now, armed with a decade of further research and patient feedback, Dr. DesMaisons has improved her groundbreaking plan to make it even more effective and easier to follow. Join the thousands who have successfully healed their addiction to sugar, lost weight, and attained maximum health and well-being by using this updated, innovative plan.</p><p>The same brain chemicals that are altered by antidepressant drugs are also affected by the foods we eat. According to addiction expert DesMaisons, many people, including those who are depressed, are "sugar sensitive." Eating sweets gives them a temporary emotional boost, which leads to a craving for still more sweets. The best way to keep these brain chemicals in the right balance and keep blood-sugar levels steady, she says, is through the dietary plan she describes in <i>Potatoes Not Prozac</i>. Her rules are fairly simple--eat three meals a day, eat proteins with every meal (especially those high in the amino acid tryptophan, which creates the calming neurotransmitter serotonin), and eat more complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains and, yes, potatoes. Not only will this make you less depressed, DesMaisons says, but it will also keep you from craving too much of the foods you <i>shouldn't</i> eat, making it a self-regulating system.Kathleen DesMaisons, PhD coined the term &#x201c;sugar sensitivity&#x201d; and is the world's leading expert on addictive nutrition,&nbsp;using dietary change to support long term healing of addiction.

Their comical adventures and perceptions celebrate the vanishing landscape of unspoilt rural England and a lifestyle soon to become obsolete. The four characters are all personifications of aspects of Belloc&#39;s own nature.</p><p>Joseph Hilaire Pierre Ren� Belloc (French; 27 July 1870 &#x2013; 16 July 1953) was an Anglo-French writer and historian. He was one of the most prolific writers in England during the early twentieth century. He was known as a writer, orator, poet, sailor, satirist, man of letters, soldier and political activist. His Catholic faith had a strong impact on his works. He was President of the Oxford Union and later MP for Salford from 1906 to 1910. He was a noted disputant, with a number of long-running feuds, but also widely regarded as a humane and sympathetic man. Belloc became a naturalised British subject in 1902, while retaining his French citizenship. His poetry encompassed comic verses for children and religious poetry. His widely sold Cautionary Tales for Children included "Jim, who ran away from his nurse, and was eaten by a lion" and "Matilda, who told lies and was burnt to death". He also collaborated with G. K. Chesterton on a number of works.</p><h2>Our Librarian Won&#39;t Tell Us Anything!

Even ore puzzling is the discovery of the broken hulk of his Cessna, half submerged in the icy waters of the Spring thaw--with the frozen body of an unidentified woman strapped in the passenger seat. Norm is nowhere to be found, and his wife, Rochelle, a pilot herself, has flown in, demanding to be included in the search.</p><p>Jensen and Rochelle begin their probe, an emotional trek through the forbidding Alaskan wilderness--a trail that turns even more ominous as they follow the fateful path of a man who has vanished without a trace, leaving behind a bundle of troublesome secrets, unanswered questions. . .and some dangerous connections in the business of murder.</p></p><p><p>SUE HENRY whose award-winning Alaska mysteries have received the highest praise from readers and critics alike, has lived in Alaska for almost a quarter of a century, and brings history, Alaskan lore, and the majestic beauty of the vast landscape to her mysteries. Based in Anchorage, where she teaches writing at the University of Alaska, Anchorage, she is currently at work on the next book in this series.</p>Love of the Alaska wilderness, a hallmark of Henry's previous books (Termination Dust), shines throughout this hymn to black bears and bush pilots. Rochelle Lewis is told that her missing husband's plane has been located during the spring thaw near Mt. Susitna, known as The Sleeping Lady. Her relief is soured when she learns that his whereabouts are still unaccounted for, but that a woman's body was found in the cockpit. Chelle flies immediately to the site only to find Alaska State Trooper Jensen investigating what is clearly a matter of foul play: the plane had been shot down and the unidentified woman had been fatally beaten before the crash. Where had Norm Lewis been taking this woman? And why hadn't he told his wife about the unscheduled charter flight? As Jensen, the medical examiner and other officials try to identify the woman and track the shooter, Chelle begins to wake from her winterlong paralysis occasioned by her husband's disappearance. But after she discovers clues to his fateful trip, she is stalked by those who want Norm's purpose hidden. While the thin plot may disappoint some mystery traditionalists, Henry's textured characterization, her attentive depiction of the wilderness area and a brown bear's spring awakening and her indignation at hunting violations will engage most armchair travelers in the lower 48. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>La Sombra Del Viento (Autores Espanoles E Iberoamericanos) (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>A literary mystery set in 1945 Barcelona where David Sempere finds a book that will change the course of his life and throw him into a labyrinth of intrigues and buried secrets in the heart of the city.</p><p>Carlos Ruiz Zaf�n es uno de los autores m�s le�dos y reconocidos en todo el mundo.

Desgranaban los primeros d�as del verano de 1945 y camin�bamos por las calles de una Barcelona atrapada bajo cielos de ceniza y un sol de vapor que se derramaba sobre la Rambla de Santa M�nica en una guirnalda de cobre l�quido.&#x2014;Daniel, lo que vas a ver hoy no se lo puedes contar a nadie &#x2014;advirti� mi padre&#x2014;. Ni a tu amigo Tom�s. A nadie.&#x2014;�Ni siquiera a mam�? &#x2014;inquir� yo, a media voz.Mi padre suspir�, amparado en aquella sonrisa triste que le persegu�a como una sombra por la vida.&#x2014;Claro que s� &#x2014;respondi� cabizbajo&#x2014;. Con ella no tenemos secretos. A ella puedes cont�rselo todo.Poco despu�s de la guerra civil, un brote de c�lera se hab�a llevado a mi madre. La enterramos en Montju�c el d�a de mi cuarto cumplea�os. S�lo recuerdo que llovi� todo el d�a y toda la noche, y que cuando le pregunt� a mi padre si el cielo lloraba le falt� la voz para responderme. Seis a�os despu�s, la ausencia de mi madre era para m� todav�a un espejismo, un silencio a gritos que a�n no hab�a aprendido a acallar con palabras. Mi padre y yo viv�amos en un peque�o piso de la calle Santa Ana, junto a la plaza de la iglesia. El piso estaba situado justo encima de la librer�a especializada en ediciones de coleccionista y libros usados heredada de mi abuelo, un bazar encantado que mi padre confiaba en que alg�n d�a pasar�a a mis manos. Me cri� entre libros, haciendo amigos invisibles en p�ginas que se deshac�an en polvo y cuyo olor a�n conservo en las manos. De ni�o aprend� a conciliar el sue�o mientras le explicaba a mi madre en la penumbra de mi habitaci�n las incidencias de la jornada, mis andanzas en el colegio, lo que hab�a aprendido aquel d�a... No pod�a o�r su voz o sentir su tacto, pero su luz y su calor ard�an en cada rinc�n de aquella casa y yo, con la fe de los que todav�a pueden contar sus a�os con los dedos de las manos, cre�a que si cerraba los ojos y le hablaba, ella podr�a o�rme desde donde estuviese. A veces, mi padre me escuchaba desde el comedor y lloraba a escondidas.Recuerdo que aquel alba de junio me despert� gritando. El coraz�n me bat�a en el pecho como si el alma quisiera abrirse camino y echar a correr escaleras abajo. Mi padre acudi� azorado a mi habitaci�n y me sostuvo en sus brazos, intentando calmarme.&#x2014;No puedo acordarme de su cara. No puedo acordarme de la cara de mam� &#x2014;murmur� sin aliento.Mi padre me abraz� con fuerza.&#x2014;No te preocupes, Daniel. Yo me acordar� por los dos.Nos miramos en la penumbra, buscando palabras que no exist�an. Aqu�lla fue la primera vez en que me di cuenta de que mi padre envejec�a y de que sus ojos, ojos de niebla y de p�rdida, siempre miraban atr�s. Se incorpor� y descorri� las cortinas para dejar entrar la tibia luz del alba.&#x2014;Anda, Daniel, v�stete. Quiero ense�arte algo &#x2014;dijo.&#x2014;�Ahora? �A las cinco de la ma�ana?&#x2014;Hay cosas que s�lo pueden verse entre tinieblas &#x2014;insinu� mi padre blandiendo una sonrisa enigm�tica que probablemente hab�a tomado prestada de alg�n tomo de Alejandro Dumas.Las calles a�n languidec�an entre neblinas y serenos cuando salimos al portal. Las farolas de las Ramblas dibujaban una avenida de vapor, parpadeando al tiempo que la ciudad se desperezaba y se desprend�a de su disfraz de acuarela. Al llegar a la calle Arco del Teatro nos aventuramos camino del Raval bajo la arcada que promet�a una b�veda de bruma azul. Segu� a mi padre a trav�s de aquel camino angosto, m�s cicatriz que calle, hasta que el reluz de la Rambla se perdi� a nuestras espaldas. La claridad del amanecer se filtraba desde balcones y cornisas en soplos de luz sesgada que no llegaban a rozar el suelo. Finalmente, mi padre se detuvo frente a un port�n de madera labrada ennegrecido por el tiempo y la humedad. Frente a nosotros se alzaba lo que me pareci� el cad�ver abandonado de un palacio, o un museo de ecos y sombras.&#x2014;Daniel, lo que vas a ver hoy no se lo puedes contar a nadie. Ni a tu amigo Tom�s. A nadie.Un hombrecillo con rasgos de ave rapaz y cabellera plateada nos abri� la puerta. Su mirada aguile�a se pos� en m�, impenetrable.&#x2014;Buenos d�as, Isaac. �ste es mi hijo Daniel &#x2014;anunci� mi padre&#x2014;. Pronto cumplir� once a�os, y alg�n d�a �l se har� cargo de la tienda. Ya tiene edad de conocer este lugar.El tal Isaac nos invit� a pasar con un leve asentimiento. Una penumbra azulada lo cubr�a todo, insinuando apenas trazos de una escalinata de m�rmol y una galer�a de frescos poblados con figuras de �ngeles y criaturas fabulosas. Seguimos al guardi�n a trav�s de aquel corredor palaciego y llegamos a una gran sala circular donde una aut�ntica bas�lica de tinieblas yac�a bajo una c�pula acuchillada por haces de luz que pend�an desde lo alto. Un laberinto de corredores y estanter�as repletas de libros ascend�a desde la base hasta la c�spide, dibujando una colmena tramada de t�neles, escalinatas, plataformas y puentes que dejaban adivinar una gigantesca biblioteca de geometr�a imposible. Mir� a mi padre, boquiabierto. �l me sonri�, gui��ndome el ojo.&#x2014;Daniel, bien venido al Cementerio de los Libros Olvidados.Salpicando los pasillos y plataformas de la biblioteca se perfilaban una docena de figuras. Algunas de ellas se volvieron a saludar desde lejos, y reconoc� los rostros de diversos colegas de mi padre en el gremio de libreros de viejo. A mis ojos de diez a�os, aquellos individuos aparec�an como una cofrad�a secreta de alquimistas conspirando a espaldas del mundo. Mi padre se arrodill� junto a m� y, sosteni�ndome la mirada, me habl� con esa voz leve de las promesas y las confidencias.&#x2014;Este lugar es un misterio, Daniel, un santuario. Cada libro, cada tomo que ves, tiene alma. El alma de quien lo escribi�, y el alma de quienes lo leyeron y vivieron y so�aron con �l. Cada vez que un libro cambia de manos, cada vez que alguien desliza la mirada por sus p�ginas, su esp�ritu crece y se hace fuerte. Hace ya muchos a�os, cuando mi padre me trajo por primera vez aqu�, este lugar ya era viejo. Quiz� tan viejo como la misma ciudad. Nadie sabe a ciencia cierta desde cu�ndo existe, o qui�nes lo crearon. Te dir� lo que mi padre me dijo a m�. Cuando una biblioteca desaparece, cuando una librer�a cierra sus puertas, cuando un libro se pierde en el olvido, los que conocemos este lugar, los guardianes, nos aseguramos de que llegue aqu�. En este lugar, los libros que ya nadie recuerda, los libros que se han perdido en el tiempo, viven para siempre, esperando llegar alg�n d�a a las manos de un nuevo lector, de un nuevo esp�ritu. En la tienda nosotros los vendemos y los compramos, pero en realidad los libros no tienen due�o. Cada libro que ves aqu� ha sido el mejor amigo de alguien. Ahora s�lo nos tienen a nosotros, Daniel. �Crees que vas a poder guardar este secreto?Mi mirada se perdi� en la inmensidad de aquel lugar, en su luz encantada. Asent� y mi padre sonri�.&#x2014;�Y sabes lo mejor? &#x2014;pregunt�.Negu� en silencio.&#x2014;La costumbre es que la primera vez que alguien visita este lugar tiene que escoger un libro, el que prefiera, y adoptarlo, asegur�ndose de que nunca desaparezca, de que siempre permanezca vivo. Es una promesa muy importante. De por vida &#x2014;explic� mi padre&#x2014;. Hoy es tu turno.Por espacio de casi media hora deambul� entre los entresijos de aquel laberinto que ol�a a papel viejo, a polvo y a magia. Dej� que mi mano rozase las avenidas de lomos expuestos, tentando mi elecci�n. Atisb�, entre los t�tulos desdibujados por el tiempo, palabras en lenguas que reconoc�a y decenas de otras que era incapaz de catalogar. Recorr� pasillos y galer�as en espiral pobladas por cientos, miles de tomos que parec�an saber m�s acerca de m� que yo de ellos. Al poco, me asalt� la idea de que tras la cubierta de cada uno de aquellos libros se abr�a un universo infinito por explorar y de que, m�s all� de aquellos muros, el mundo dejaba pasar la vida en tardes de f�tbol y seriales de radio, satisfecho con ver hasta all� donde alcanza su ombligo y poco m�s. Quiz� fue aquel pensamiento, quiz� el azar o su pariente de gala, el destino, pero en aquel mismo instante supe que ya hab�a elegido el libro que iba a adoptar. O quiz� debiera decir el libro que me iba a adoptar a m�. Se asomaba t�midamente en el extremo de una estanter�a, encuadernado en piel de color vino y susurrando su t�tulo en letras doradas que ard�an a la luz que destilaba la c�pula desde lo alto. Me acerqu� hasta �l y acarici� las palabras con la yema de los dedos, leyendo en silencio.<i>La Sombra del Viento</i>Juli�n CaraxJam�s hab�a o�do mencionar aquel t�tulo o a su autor, pero no me import�. La decisi�n estaba tomada. Por ambas partes. Tom� el libro con sumo cuidado y lo hoje�, dejando aletear sus p�ginas. Liberado de su celda en el estante, el libro exhal� una nube de polvo dorado. Satisfecho con mi elecci�n, reh�ce mis pasos en el laberinto portando mi libro bajo el brazo con una sonrisa impresa en los labios. Tal vez la atm�sfera hechicera de aquel lugar hab�a podido conmigo, pero tuve la seguridad de que aquel libro hab�a estado all� esper�ndome durante a�os, probablemente desde antes de que yo naciese.Aquella tarde, de vuelta en el piso de la calle Santa Ana, me refugi� en mi habitaci�n y decid� leer las primeras l�neas de mi nuevo amigo. Antes de darme cuenta, me hab�a ca�do dentro sin remedio. La novela relataba la historia de un hombre en busca de su verdadero padre, al que nunca hab�a llegado a conocer y cuya existencia s�lo descubr�a merced a las �ltimas palabras que pronunciaba su madre en su lecho de muerte. La historia de aquella b�squeda se transformaba en una odisea fantasmag�rica en la que el protagonista luchaba por recuperar una infancia y una juventud perdidas, y en la que, lentamente, descubr�amos la sombra de un amor maldito cuya memoria le habr�a de perseguir hasta el fin de sus d�as. A medida que avanzaba, la estructura del relato empez� a recordarme a una de esas mu�ecas rusas que contienen innumerables miniaturas de s� mismas en su interior. Paso a paso, la narraci�n se descompon�a en mil historias, como si el relato hubiese penetrado en una galer�a de espejos y su identidad se escindiera en docenas de reflejos diferentes y al tiempo uno solo. Los minutos y las horas se deslizaron como un espejismo. Horas m�s tarde, atrapado en el relato, apenas advert� las campanadas de medianoche en la catedral repiqueteando a lo lejos. Enterrado en la luz de cobre que proyectaba el flexo, me sumerg� en un mundo de im�genes y sensaciones como jam�s las hab�a conocido. Personajes que se me antojaron tan reales como el aire que respiraba me arrastraron en un t�nel de aventura y misterio del que no quer�a escapar. P�gina a p�gina, me dej� envolver por el sortilegio de la historia y su mundo hasta que el aliento del amanecer acarici� mi ventana y mis ojos cansados se deslizaron por la �ltima p�gina. Me tend� en la penumbra azulada del alba con el libro sobre el pecho y escuch� el rumor de la ciudad dormida goteando sobre los tejados salpicados de p�rpura. El sue�o y la fatiga llamaban a mi puerta, pero me resist� a rendirme. No quer�a perder el hechizo de la historia ni todav�a decir adi�s a sus personajes.En una ocasi�n o� comentar a un cliente habitual en la librer�a de mi padre que pocas cosas marcan tanto a un lector como el primer libro que realmente se abre camino hasta su coraz�n. Aquellas primeras im�genes, el eco de esas palabras que creemos haber dejado atr�s, nos acompa�an toda la vida y esculpen un palacio en nuestra memoria al que, tarde o temprano &#x2014;no importa cu�ntos libros leamos, cu�ntos mundos descubramos, cu�nto aprendamos u olvidemos&#x2014;, vamos a regresar. Para m�, esas p�ginas embrujadas siempre ser�n las que encontr� entre los pasillos del Cementerio de los Libros Olvidados.</p><h2>Science Fiction Tales: Invaders, Creatures and Alien Worlds</h2><p>&#34;Short, uncomplicated action tales, which generally feature a child protagonist and a good swift shock at the end.

But I&#x2019;m so glad I read Imogen Hermes Gowar&#x2019;s <em>The Mermaid and Mrs. Hancock</em> or I would have missed one of the most delicious debuts of 2018. A Georgian romp reminiscent of Sarah Waters&#x2019;s wonderfully bawdy Victorian-era novels, it follows the unlikely courtship of a celebrated courtesan and a decidedly undazzling merchant. The latter has come into a windfall, owing to the sale of a deceased merbaby (just go with it&#x2014;the writing is <em>that</em> good), but it turns out that their union isn&#x2019;t just reliant on the size of his...wallet. <em>The Mermaid and Mrs. Hancock</em> is a treat of a read with clever, immersive dialog and enough twists and turns to make you wish the word count was even more generous (it's 496 pages). But it also slyly scrutinizes class, gender, and race divides&#x2014;adding a layer of depth to a novel that is hopefully the first of many for Ms. Gowar. <em>&#x2014;Erin Kodicek, Amazon Book Review</em><p>Imogen Hermes Gowar studied Archaeology, Anthropology and Art History at UEA&#x2019;s Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts before going on to work in museums.&nbsp;She began to write small pieces of fiction inspired by the artefacts she worked with and around, and in 2013 won the Malcolm Bradbury Memorial Scholarship to study for an MA in Creative Writing at UEA.&nbsp;</p><p>She won the Curtis Brown Prize for her dissertation, which grew into a novel titled&nbsp;<em>The Mermaid and Mrs Hancock</em>.

His maternal grandmother, daughter of Chief Cloudman of the Mdewankton Sioux, was married to a well-known western artist, Captain Seth Eastman, and in 1847 their daughter Mary Nancy Eastman became the wife of Chief Many Lightnings, a Wahpeton Sioux. Their fifth child, Charles Alexander Eastman, as a four-year old was given the name Ohiyesa (the Winner). During the Sioux Uprising of 1862 Ohiyesa became separated from his father&#x2014;his mother had died soon after his birth-and fled from the reservation in Minnesota to Canada under the protection of his grandmother and uncle. There he was schooled in the Indian ways until the age of fifteen, when he was reunited with his father, who took him back to his homestead in present South Dakota. <p>Eastman went on to become one of the best-known Indians of his time, receiving a Bachelor of Science degree from Dartmouth in 1887 and a medical degree from Boston University three years later. From his first appointment as a physician at Pine Ridge Agency, where he witnessed the events that culminated in the Wounded Knee massacre, he sought to bring understanding between Native and non-Native Americans. In addition to two autobiographical works, <i>Indian Boyhood</i> (1902) and <i>From the Deep Woods to Civilization</i> (1916), Charles Eastman wrote nine other books, some in collaboration with his wife, Elaine Goodale Eastman (who has told her story in <i>Sister to the Sioux</i>, also a Bison Book).</p><p>In <i>The Soul of the Indian</i>, first published in 1911, the author's aim has been "to paint the religious life of the typical American Indian as it was before he knew the white man."</p></p><p></p><h2>Gene Logsdon&#39;s Wildlife in Your Garden: Or Dealing With Deer, Rabbits, Raccoons, Moles, Crows, Sparrows, and Other of Nature&#39;s Creatures : In Ways th</h2><p>Recommends techniques for attracting helpful animals to a garden and controlling garden pests without upsetting the ecological balance</p><p></p><h2>Please Excuse This Poem: 100 New Poets for the Next Generation</h2><p>One hundred poems.

As with love and other experiences, there is a first time and it is remembered. The first poem might be written on the back of something else, or in a notebook shown to no one. It might be a poem where <i>someone falls in love with someone but that person falls in love with someone else</i>. It might be a poem about <i>floating alone / in the cold blue</i>, or about sex or <i>the distance / between a missed train and love</i>. The poet begins to understand that when she picks up her pen, she doesn&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s going to happen. The poet knows only that when he&#x2019;s writing, his true self is speaking on paper or in his thoughts, strangely and without fear. This anthology is a collection of such poems. They are filled with ending up <i>in the wrong adventure</i>, and with <i>the little things we tell ourselves about our pasts</i>. One poet writes, <i>Inside here are many moments</i>, and it is true: the neighborhood, <i>summer boredom, handsome drugs, suburban rabbits // and warrens of junkies</i> and <i>the number of clips emptied / into an unarmed Guinean man / on a dark Bronx stoop</i>. A <i>father&#x2019;s embrace</i> is here, and a grandmother who <i>only wants to tell&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who died / and how</i>. Another poet writes, <i>I hope we all die just like this, in someone else&#x2019;s arms, young and beautiful and true</i>. In these poems, we sleep under the stars, get stopped by the police, and hang from trestles as the trains come. In these poems <i>a good way to fall in love / is to turn off the headlights / and drive very fast down dark roads</i>. Inside the poet there is <i>the burning chandelier&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. where the language begins</i>. The poet tries <i>to dance like firelight / without setting anyone ablaze</i>. Inside, the poet is <i>dreaming of tornadoes again, too many for the sky to contain</i>. Another <i>spent all night / collecting your photographs / and cutting them up</i>. These poems were written young, but death isn&#x2019;t absent here: <i>there&#x2019;s a dead woman in the river / dead baby in the cradle / there&#x2019;s a dead soldier in the desert / &amp; three crows wonder over and over / whether to cry out</i>.</p><p>Most poets continue to write in secret until they trust someone enough to show her a poem, and this sharing continues one to another until the poems are strong enough to be sent out into the world, as these poems have been, the poems you are holding now, and as your poems may someday be sent, because why not? <i>When you look down / inside yourself / what is there?</i> It is a question any of us can ask ourselves as poems begin within us. There is often a feeling that precedes or accompanies the poem as it is born, and the poets write, <i>I can&#x2019;t shake that something is coming. I opened wide my door to it</i>. <i>I&#x2019;ll sleep when I&#x2019;m dead</i>. These one hundred poems, drafted by one hundred younger poets firmly launched on their careers, will provide writers with inspiration and aspiration, and all readers with exhilaration. In poems you will never <i>run out of ways to say I am here</i>. And having read this far, you also know what it means to be <i>waiting, like an animal, / For poetry</i>.</p><p>Carolyn Forch�</p><p></p><p></p><p>JAKOB</p><p>Dorothea Lasky</p><p>I am sick of feeling</p><p>I never eat or sleep</p><p>I just sit here and let the words burn into me</p><p>I know you love her</p><p>And don&#x2019;t love me</p><p>No, I don&#x2019;t think you love her</p><p>I know there are clouds that are very pretty</p><p>I know there are clouds that trundle round the globe</p><p>I take anything I can to get to love</p><p>Live things are what the world is made of</p><p>Live things are black</p><p>Black in that they forgot where they came from</p><p>I have not forgotten, however I choose not to feel</p><p>Those places that have burned into me</p><p>There is too much burning here, I&#x2019;m afraid</p><p>Readers, you read flat words</p><p>Inside here are many moments</p><p>In which I have screamed in pain</p><p>As the flames ate me</p><p></p><p></p><p>BARBOUR STREET</p><p>Samuel Amadon</p><p>My junior year of high school I had</p><p>to go all spring to this</p><p>middle school on Barbour Street</p><p>for an afterschool thing for college</p><p>applications or whatever</p><p>&amp; I tried to look like I wanted to</p><p>be there but those kids knew I didn&#x2019;t</p><p>&amp; they could see I didn&#x2019;t know</p><p>shit about them or their neighborhood</p><p>so it&#x2019;s not surprising they didn&#x2019;t wave</p><p>that summer when Spencer</p><p>&amp; I rode past them day after day</p><p>on the way to the gym where we were</p><p>getting ready for football</p><p>season or fucking off on our bikes</p><p>&amp; Spencer kept pointing out to me</p><p>how even though a block</p><p>out there was about twice as long</p><p>as my block instead of there being</p><p>three hydrants evenly placed</p><p>along it there was only one at the end</p><p>of each so there had better not</p><p>be any fires in the middle</p><p>of those streets which I would think</p><p>about the summer I was back from</p><p>school when I&#x2019;d drive</p><p>Ray Rose home from work at this</p><p>Italian restaurant where Kenny got</p><p>me a job.

Luckily, the Oregon Ducks&#x2019; 1995 Rose Bowl berth caught the attention of the school&#x2019;s wealthiest alumnus: Nike founder Phil Knight, who was seeking new marketing angles at the collegiate level. And so the University of Nike was born: Knight has so far donated more than half a billion dollars to the school in exchange for high-visibility branding opportunities. <br><br>But as journalist Joshua Hunt shows in <i>University of Nike</i>, Oregon has paid dearly for the veneer of financial prosperity and athletic success that has come with this brand partnering. <br><br>Hunt uncovers efforts to conceal university records, buried sexual assault allegations against university athletes, and cases of corporate overreach into academics and campus life&#x2014;all revealing a university being run like a business, with America&#x2019;s favorite &#x201c;Shoe Dog&#x201d; calling the shots. Nike money has shaped everything from Pac-10 television deals to the way the game is played, from the landscape of the campus to the type of student the university hopes to attract.<br><br>More alarming still, Hunt finds other schools taking a page from Oregon&#x2019;s playbook. Never before have our public institutions for research and higher learning been so thoroughly and openly under the sway of private interests, and never before has the blueprint for funding American higher education been more fraught with ethical, legal, and academic dilemmas. <br><br>Encompassing more than just sports and the academy, <i>University of Nike</i> is a riveting story of our times.</p><p><b>Joshua Hunt</b> is a former foreign correspondent for Reuters in Tokyo. His work has also appeared in the&nbsp;<i>New Yorker</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Bloomberg Businessweek</i>, <i>The California Sunday Magazine</i>, and <i>The Atavist Magazine</i>. He is a graduate of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, where he was a fellow at the Toni Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism and a recipient of the Lynton Fellowship in Book Writing.University of Nike <br><b>Introduction</b><p>In May 2014, I traveled to Eugene, Oregon, to cover a developing story for <i>The New York Times</i>: two months earlier, a freshman at the University of Oregon had told local police she&#x2019;d been gang-raped by three of the school&#x2019;s basketball players. Campus police were aware of the incident just hours after it occurred, and university administrators knew by the following day. But instead of alerting the campus community and suspending the players, they kept the matter quiet and allowed the men to participate in the NCAA basketball tournament.</p><p>Throughout March and April, the school&#x2019;s public relations department worked on a media strategy to employ in case the story broke; school administrators quietly brokered a deal that would allow the accused players to transfer to another institution at the end of the academic year, with no incriminating paperwork that might follow them; and campus police were careful to omit from the school&#x2019;s public crime log any mention of the report. When May arrived, it looked as though the school had managed to avoid a major scandal. Then the Eugene Police Department released a graphic twenty-four-page police report the victim had filed, sparking intense media coverage that led to the suspension of the players and, several months later, the resignation of the university&#x2019;s president, Michael Gottfredson.</p><p>I was left with a number of nagging questions: Why had the school recruited one of these players despite the fact that his previous college had suspended him for sexually assaulting a fellow student? Why were the players allowed to keep playing basketball with such serious charges hanging over their heads? And why did the school ignore federal laws requiring them to notify the public when crimes of this nature were reported to campus police?</p><p>University administrators refused to talk with me, and occasionally locked themselves in their offices until I left the buildings where they worked. The players also refused to talk with me, while their lawyers insisted that the sex had been consensual. The school&#x2019;s office of public records produced mostly useless, heavily redacted records concerning its handling of the incident, and even the school&#x2019;s public relations professionals proved to be tight-lipped: before turning down each of my requests for an interview with some administrator or another, the director of public affairs, Tobin Klinger, would always ask me the same question: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your angle?&#x201d;</p><p>And each time I told him I wouldn&#x2019;t have an angle until my notebook was filled with more answers than questions.</p><p>I began to hear troubling stories about the University of Oregon&#x2019;s relationship with Nike. Over the course of two decades, the shoe and apparel company&#x2019;s founder, Phil Knight, had become the school&#x2019;s most generous donor. They called him Uncle Phil, not just on campus but around town, and it was easy to see why&#x2014;when my parents moved the family away from Eugene, in 1995, it was a quiet college town filled with young hippies and former millworkers. Nearly two decades later, it was Niketown, U.S.A.</p><p>The University of Oregon, which was once a cash-strapped liberal arts college, had been transformed into a college football powerhouse with an increasingly competitive basketball program. The change was so swift and dramatic, and so obviously tied to Knight&#x2019;s largesse, that Oregon&#x2019;s rivals gave it the derisive nickname the University of Nike&#x2014;an image it has now embraced. Other schools are embracing that kind of image as well: in 2016, the University of Michigan announced a $169 million contract with Nike, which was the biggest in the history of college sports, until the University of Texas at Austin inked a $250 million Nike deal just months later.</p><p>It all began nearly thirty years ago, when Oregonians became the first in the nation to abandon their public universty system by voting for property tax cuts that left state colleges to fend for themselves. A decade later, dozens more states had set out on the same path, which has led us here: in 2017, for the first time, public colleges and universities in most states drew the majority of their revenue from tuition dollars rather than taxpayer support. The American public has, in other words, become a minority shareholder in the nation&#x2019;s public universities. And what happens next is all too clear if you know where to look.</p><p>I began with a notebook full of questions, a campus full of rumors, and a sense that the University of Oregon was a canary worth following down a coal mine. My goal was not to write a biography of Phil Knight, whose life and career have been documented more extensively, and more flatteringly, in books authored by his friends, his colleagues, and himself. If my portrait of Knight seems overly critical, it is because I&#x2019;ve sought to document a narrow slice of his life that has proven to be consistently controversial&#x2014;namely, the extent to which his financial support of the University of Oregon has bought him influence over an institution that is meant to serve public, rather than private, interests. Four years after I began investigating Knight&#x2019;s dealings with the university, my notebook had far fewer questions than answers, thanks to well over a hundred interviews, supplemented by many thousands of pages of financial, legal, and archival documents.</p><p>At last, I have &#x201c;my angle.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic</h2><p>In this great philosophical essay, Henri Bergson explores why people laugh and what laughter means. Written at the turn of the twentieth century, <i>Laughter</i> explores what it is in language that makes a joke funny and what it is in us that makes us laugh.<br>One of the functions of humor, according to Bergson, is to help us retain our humanity during an age of mechanization. Like other philosophers, novelists, poets, and humorists of his era, Bergson was concerned with the duality of man and machine. His belief in life as a vital impulse, indefinable by reason alone, informs his perception of comedy as the relief we experience upon distancing ourselves from the mechanistic and materialistic. "A situation is always comic," Bergson notes, "if it participates simultaneously in two series of events which are absolutely independent of each other, and if it can be interpreted in two quite different meanings." The philosopher's thought-provoking insights (e.g., "It seems that laughter needs an echo. Our laughter is always the laughter of a group.") keep this work ever-relevant as a thesis on the principles of humor.</p><p>Clem Kadiddlehopper wore a funny hat. Even animals other than humans seem to laugh, because they, too, possess emotions. And sometimes, when you're by yourself, you just start giggling for no reason. But that's not funny. As Henri Bergson, proto-existentialist French philosopher and author of <i>Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic</i>, would say, you can stop laughing now. We must rethink what tickles us. For Bergson, laughter is a purely intellectual response that serves the social purpose of assuaging discomfort over the unaccustomed and unexpected. We chuckle at Lucy attempting to wrap the bonbons speeding by on a candy-factory conveyor belt because she's stuck in one place, performing the same task over and over, and failing; we hope that in similar situations we could be more flexible. Bergson recaps: "Rigidity is the comic, and laughter is its corrective."<p> Bergson's thinking typifies a peculiarly Gallic tendency to rationalize the apparently ephemeral and subjective (in this case, humor), discussing it in exquisitely rarefied language in order to assert that which defies common sense (a funny hat is not funny, laughter expresses no emotion, no one laughs alone) but partakes nonetheless of a logical inevitability. <i>Laughter</i>, first published in 1911, clearly draws upon the early years of European modernism, yet also prefigures the movement in some ways. In recognizing the comic as it embodies itself in a "rigid," absentminded person, locked into repetitious, socially awkward behavior, Bergson--even as he looks backward, primarily to Moli�re--seems to be spawning the sophisticated visual and physical comedy of Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd; the transformation of L�ger's figures into anthropoid machines; and Nijinsky's starring role in Stravinsky's satirical clockwork ballet <i>P�trouchka</i>.</p><p> This little book resurrects a British translation that has long been out of print. While <i>Laughter</i> won't quite explain why the French love Jerry Lewis, or keep you in stitches, it's a bracing read that will make you think twice about laughing the next time someone stumbles into a lamppost. <i>--Robert Burns Neveldine</i></p>COSIMO CLASSICS offers distinctive titles by the great authors and thinkers who have inspired, informed and engaged readers throughout the ages. <p>Covering a diverse range of subjects that include Health &amp; Science, Eastern Philosophy, Mythology &amp; Sacred Texts, Philosophy &amp; Spirituality, and Business &amp; Economics these newly revitalized treasures are now available to contemporary readers.</p></p><h2>Well Said!: Presentations and Conversations That Get Results</h2><p>Whether you&#x2019;re making a formal presentation, wooing a client, closing a sale, or proposing an idea, persuasive communication is essential.

In 1903 he single-handedly turned a small diplomatic mission into a full-scale military invasion of the last unexplored country on earth, Tibet. Yet he subsequently became an outlandish mystical philosopher and an Indian nationalist. Admired by Bertrand Russell, Lord Curzon, H. G. Wells and John Buchan, Younghusband held the world record for the 300-yard dash, was The Times correspondent during the siege of Chitral, became the first European since Marco Polo to find a new overland route from China to India, and organized the early assaults on Mount Everest.<br>In a life that provides a rare glimpse into the spirit of his times, Younghusband embraced and personified, without apparent contradiction, the two cultures of late British imperialism. He spent much of his early life as a leading player in the Great Game - the battle of wits for control over the uncharted territory of High Asia - and his presumed death as a spy in the Pamirs almost sparked off a war between British India and Tsarist Russia. But despite being a classic Edwardian, full of pomposity and repression, in the post-First World War era he led the way in religious, philosophical and sexual free-thinking.</p><p>Sir Francis Younghusband was the last of the great imperialists&#x2014;a dashing adventurer, who in 1903 single&#x2013;handedly invaded Tibet, wiped out its entire army, and then became a mystic.

Their father was character actor John Carradine, and David Carradine says they were once considered princes of Hollywood. His autobiography is breezy and anecdotal and so good-natured?even when blaming everyone else for all its author's failures?that only toward the end does it come through as the dreary catalogue of human disaster it actually is. Carradine tried to kill himself when he was five. Later, his drunken mother, confusing him with his long-departed father, tried to seduce him. Schooling consisted of one expulsion after another. The high point of his acting career came in the early 1970s with Kung Fu, a popular TV series. As recorded here, the rest of his adult life is remembered in terms of LSD, pot, peyote, cocaine, alcohol, unsuccessful films, cars, horses, wives and wandering children. And always there are blithely belabored excuses for everything. The book ends with a long journal of the first seven months of 1995, with Carradine attending A.A. meetings and shooting a new Kung Fu series on the cheap in Canada. Photos. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Admirers of the popular Kung Fu television series may be disappointed that Carradine, who starred as the introspective, ascetic Kwai Chang Caine, reveals himself in this autobiography as a fairly stereotypical, thrice-married Hollywood actor fond of fast cars, women, drugs, and tequila. While a narrative along these lines has some entertainment potential, Carradine's unexciting prose is rather trite and at times simply crass, making the reader wish he had collaborated with a professional writer to edit the overlong text and more eloquently express his innermost feelings. Most interesting is Carradine's recollections of his famous father, John Carradine, whose friend John Barrymore made a lasting impression on David and influenced his acting style. His poignant description of his father's death in Milan is one of the few moments when genuinely sensitive emotion seems to come across. Considerably more engrossing is David's book Spirit of Shaolin (LJ 12/91), in which he discusses the making of Kung Fu and his involvement with Eastern philosophy and martial arts.

In this small book readers will discover Heart Yoga, which developed over the centuries in the Gelukpa tradition of the Dalai Lamas. The program presented here combines popular yoga exercises wtih special Tibetan poses, and methods of working from the inside to give a healthy and a happy heart. <br><br>Roach discovered a number of previously unknown Tibetan works on yoga in the course of his ongoing efforts to find and preserve ancient Tibetan Buddhist texts. He discusses the ideas and insights presented in these texts and places them within the context of the Buddhist tradition. To help readers incorporate this ancient wisdom in their daily lives, he provides a specific regime of yoga postures and meditations. Combining instructive illustrations with the unique philosophical underpinnings of the Buddhist approach, Geshe Roach has created a unique program for yoga on a physical and spiritual level.</p><p>Geshe Michael Roach's <i>The Tibetan Book of Yoga</i> is an excellent second yoga book for someone who is interested in Buddhism and is looking to deepen his or her yoga practice. The slim volume--based on Heart Yoga from the Gelukpa tradition of the Dalai Lamas--delves more into the philosophy behind the poses than their practice. In the first four chapters Roach provides a quick history of Heart Yoga and introduces the uniquely Tibetan Buddhist aspects of the practice. Drawing on Tibetan conceptions of human physiology, Heart Yoga imagines five levels to work in each yoga pose. These levels include the physical body and the breath but also encompass the "inner winds" (internal energy channels), thoughts, and "world-seeds" (each seed is a part of karma that "ripens when we look at something, and colors how we see it"). <p></p> Heart Yoga is infused with <i>tong-len</i>, a Tibetan meditation of "giving and taking" where the practitioner generates compassion through a mental image of taking away pain from others and giving joy. In later chapters, Roach walks his readers through the 10 exercises that form the core of the daily, 30-minute Heart Yoga practice. Each exercise is described in modest detail (with a few accompanying black-and-white photographs) before Geshe Roach offers his commentary on how the exercise serves the development of the five levels. Throughout, he remains centered on the fifth level, world-seeds, and the generation of compassion, as the vital foundation for successful, long-term practice. <p></p> Roach, the first American to receive the title "Geshe," has done a valuable service in bringing these ancient Tibetan traditions to a wider, English-speaking audience. But <i>The Tibetan Book of Yoga</i> is not a comprehensive guide for a yoga beginner. Roach suggests in the text that readers "piggy back" on other yoga teachers and teachings to learn correct pose form and avoid injury. In the end, <i>The Tibetan Book of Yoga</i> fills an important niche in Western yoga as an introduction to Tibetan philosophy of yoga, an introduction that may well spawn a new generation of books, videos and schools to expand on its teaching. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i><b>MICHAEL ROACH </b>is a fully ordained Buddhist monk and has been a teacher of Buddhism since 1981. He was the first American to receive the title of Geshe. He is also a scholar of Sanskrit, Tibetan, and, Russian and has translated many works in these languages into English.

With these reifying, revivifying words, Manhattan's Museum of Modern Art photography director Szarkowski ( The Photographer's Eye ) embarks on what is perhaps his most ambitious book. Less a conventional history of photography than a carefully ordered series of reflections on the stages of the art, the volume begins with the invention of the camera obscura by Johannes Kepler in 1611 and concludes, in a chapter entitled "After the Magazines," with the enormous growth of audience and technical innovation for photography that began in the 1940s--when Magnum was founded to meet photographic needs and improve the standards of magazines around the world. Szarkowski's exquisite eye, as exemplified by photographs included here by Josef Albers, Eliott Erwitt, William Henry Fox Talbot, Timothy H. O'Sullivan, anonymous greats and many others, is matched by prose whose grace is equal to its deep seriousness. The book, a tie-in to a MOMA exhibition, is essential for anyone with an interest in photography or culture in larger terms. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.This late entry among the numerous lush books and traveling exhibitions celebrating photography's sesquicentennial is well worth the wait. Szarkowski, director of photography at MOMA for 25 years, finally presents his own history of photography in the articulate prose for which he is widely respected. He supports his observations with an exciting choice of well-reproduced and seldom-seen images: portraits, news and war photos, landscapes, still lifes, architectural views, advertising, and medical images. Chronological chapters trace the mutual influences and evolution of technology and style, from "Before Photography" to the post-1960s period, "After the Magazines." He has bypassed derivative images in favor of those pictures, old and new, that show what photography does best. A small complaint: the omission of the photographic process in the picture captions. Full information about each image and photographer is provided in the end matter. Highly recommended for photography and art history collections.<br><i>- Kathleen Collins, Great Barrington, Mass.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dare We Hope That All Men Be Saved?

The information is organized by highway, so that modern-day explorers can follow the road logs easily, learning about the land they travel through. <p>Of the tradition of roadside geologic descriptions, Buchanan and McCauley write: "In some ways highways provide convenient access to geology because roads often cut through hills, exposing formations never seen before. . . . For many geologist, road construction is an occasion akin to Christmas or the Fourth of July." </p><p>The nine highways, which criss-cross Kansas, were chosen for a variety of reasons. Some, like I-70, I-35, and the Kansas Turnpike, carry heavy traffic; some, like U.S. Highways 69 and 36, are the main highways in various parts of the state; others, like U.S. Highways 160 and 83, cut through some of the state's most interesting geology; and one, U.S. Highway 56, was picked because of its history--the road parallels the historic Santa Fe Trail for much of its route, passing the site of old forts and Indian battles. </p><p>This unique guidebook combines geological, historical, and cultural information with more than 100 photographs, drawings, and maps. Presented in a refreshingly nontechnical way, it is sure to appeal to tourist and native Kansas alike.</p></p><p>"For those of us who drive Kansas--and love it--this book is a wonder."--James J. Fisher, columnist, <i>Kansas City Times</i> <p>"Fascinating and informative. this book showed me a Kansas I've never seen before."--Ron Welch, editor, <i>Kansas Motorist</i> </p><p>"Travel the highways and see the terrain formed by elemental forces--limestone cliffs layered by ancient seas, boulders left by glaciers from the ice age, mysterious sink-holes, everlasting wells--all in this fascinating kaleidoscope of geology, history, pioneer tales, amusing anecdotes, and incidental information about the state."--Zula Bennington Greene, better known as popular columnist Peggy of the Flint Hills </p><p>"A tremendous compilation. . . .

He held a special interest for natural history, ethnology and exploration and made numerous expeditions for the American Museum of Natural History and the National Geographic Society. He went on to edit various magazines on travel and world affairs and spent six years working in Japan as foreign correspondent for New York and London newspapers. He wrote fourteen adventure stories featuring Hal and Roger Hunt and travelled in seventy-seven countries before his death in 1983."Price knew all the right buttons to press to excite a young reader -- exotic locations, nasty villains, wild animals and lashings of peril." --David Barnett, <i>The Guardian</i></p><h2>A Gospel Primer for Christians: Learning to See the Glories of God&#39;s Love</h2><p>By showing how you can preach the gospel to yourself each day, this book will help you savor the glories of God&#39;s love and experience the life-transforming power of the gospel in all areas of life.</p><p>Milton Vincent has been Pastor-Teacher at Cornerstone Fellowship Bible Church in Riverside, CA since 1992.</p><h2>Finding Peace, Happiness, and Joy</h2><p>The gospel offers us the unmatched gifts of peace, happiness, and joy, but sometimes these promises seem elusive and unattainable. In his familiar, warm style, Elder Richard G. Scott of the Quorum of the Twelve outlines the truths we need to understand and embrace to live a life of peace, happiness, and joy. He covers such important topics as developing a godly character, receiving and responding to heavenly guidance, repenting of our sins, loving others, and learning to cope with what sems unfair. Using insightful stories and examples, Elder Scott mentors the reader while at the same time he teaches with profound apostolic counsel. If we will trust in the Lord&#39;s promises and accept the gifts he offers us, if we are obedient to his commandments, then we too can fulfill the scriptural declaration, &#34;Men are, that they might have joy.&#34;</p><p>Elder Richard G. Scott was called to the First Quorum of the Seventy in 1977 and was sustained as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve in 1988. He received a bachelor&#39;s degree in mechanical engineering from George Washington Universtiy and completed postgraduate work in nuclear engineering. Elder Scott worked on the staff of Admiral Hyman Rickover (considered the father of the nuclear navy) developing military and private nuclear power reactors, and was a consultant to the nuclear power industry. He and his wife, Jeanene Watkins Scott, are the parents of seven children. Sister Scott passed away in 1995.</p><h2>Lucy&#39;s Specific Carbohydrate Diet Cookbook</h2><p>Great cookbook for those on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet, detailed in the book, Breaking the Vicious Cycle: Intestinal Health Through Diet, by Elaine Gottschall. 118 pages of recipes for those suffering from Crohn&#39;s Disease, Ulcerative Collitis, Diverticulitis, Celiac Disease, and Chronic Diarrhea.

Like George Orwell or Gore Vidal, Dirda delights in popular genres, such as the detective novel and the ghost story, without neglecting the deeper satisfactions of sometimes-overlooked classics. This new work features scores of Dirda's most engaging essays, never previously collected in book form, all intended to introduce readers to wonderful writers, from the anecdotal Herodotus and James Boswell to the sensuous Colette and Steven Millhauser to such European masters as Joseph Roth, Flann O'Brien, and Penelope Fitzgerald. With his trademark enthusiasm, Dirda also explores <em>The Arabian Nights</em>, the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone, the crime novels of Chester Himes and K. C. Constantine, and the worlds of Tarzan, Cormac McCarthy, and Proust. <em>Bound to Please</em> is a glorious celebration of just how much fun reading can be.</p><p>Michael Dirda, who won a Pulitzer Prize for distinguished criticism at the&nbsp;Washington Post Book World, is the author of&nbsp;An Open Book,&nbsp;Bound to Please, and&nbsp;Readings: Essays and Literary Entertainments. He lives in Silver Spring, Maryland.Starred Review. In the opening of this marvelous collection of book reviews, Dirda declares that his book "intentionally resembles a cocktail party more than a work of criticism: it&#x2019;s meant to be entertaining, sometimes provocative, above all a way to catch up with old friends and make new ones." The author himself serves as the perfect host: intelligent but humble, witty but substantial, instructive but never dogmatic. Dirda, who has worked as a writer and editor at the Washington Post Book World for more than 20 years, and who won a Pulitzer for his criticism in 1993, arranges his volume by topic so that readers interested in, say, the Renaissance, can turn to the section on "Old Masters" and find essays on both Umberto Eco&#x2019;s novel The Name of the Rose and Peter Brown&#x2019;s history The Rise of Western Christendom. Dirda is particularly deft at presenting well-known classics in a way that makes them seem fresh and inviting. Of Rabelais&#x2019;s characters he writes, for example: "You wouldn&#x2019;t want them for neighbors, but they&#x2019;d be great on your side in a fight." And he&#x2019;s tops at conveying the pleasure of reading itself. In fact, if there&#x2019;s one problem with his collection, it&#x2019;s that its essays are so tantalizing that they make you want to put down his book and run out to read a whole slew of new ones. But this, it&#x2019;s clear, is exactly what Dirda wants. He&#x2019;s included only the most praiseworthy reviews in this volume, with the hope that they will encourage readers "to look beyond the boundaries of the fashionable, established, or academic" and to become familiar with "terrific writers from around the world," such as Fernando Pessoa, Marcel Proust and Mikhail Bulgakov. Any serious reader will appreciate these gracious recommendations from one of the best literary journalists of our time.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Here we find the work of such architectural luminaries as Addison Mizner, Bertram Goodhue, and Reginald D. Johnson. We wander from the historic adobe mansion Casa de la Guerra-- built in the early-nineteenth century by town patriarch Jose de la Guerra-- to the spectacular, and aptly named, Villa Lucia (House of the Light)-- built in 1989. We are given an intimate look at George Washington Smith's Spanish Colonial Revival masterpiece, Casa del Herrero; and a broad view of Lotusland, the thirty-seven acre horticultural paradise.

In fact, it was an interest in collecting and restoring antiques that led him into the world of art. Pelletier's highly colorful work is enhanced by his sense of humour and love of tradition. He, his wife and several cats live in Ormstown, Quebec, in a house reminiscent of the one he painted for <i>A Happy New Year's Day</i>, his first picture book. </p><p> Jonathan London has written many books for children, including <i>Dream Weaver</i>, illustrated by Rocco Baviera, and most recently, <i>Froggy's Baby Sister</i>. Jonathan lives with his wife, Maureen, and their two sons, Sean and Aaron, in Northern California. He and his sons often go hiking in the hills near their home. </p>Kindergarten-Grade 4?The day before Paul's first maple-sugaring party, he asks his grandmother to tell him about her first sugaring-off, long ago. Grand-mere describes the family's sleigh journey to Tante Loulou's sugar bush, the songs and games, the feasting and dancing, and the delicious maple syrup candy. London's evocative text perfectly re-creates the thrill and excitement of this coming-of-spring ritual. Pelletier's folk-art paintings, reminiscent of Grandma Moses's work, match the nostalgic tone of this story set in Canada. Children will enjoy the bright colors and pore over the details, but they may question why young Grand-mere, who describes herself as "tiny," is the same size as her older sisters. A glossary at the end of the book defines the French-Canadian terms and gives pronunciations (though place names and words used in the illustrations are not included). Kathryn Lasky's Sugaring Time (Macmillan, 1983) and Diane Burns's Sugaring Season (Carolrhoda, 1990) are for older readers and concentrate on the mechanics of the maple-syrup process.

Roth&#x2019;s comic genius, his imaginative daring, his courage in exploring uncomfortable truths, and his assault on political, cultural, and sexual orthodoxies have made him one of the essential writers of our time. By special arrangement with the author, The Library of America now inaugurates the definitive edition of Roth&#x2019;s collected works. This first volume presents&nbsp;<i>Goodbye, Columbus and Five Short Stories</i>, the book that established Roth&#x2019;s reputation on publication in 1959 and for which he won the National Book Award, and his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Letting Go</i>&nbsp;(1962).<br><br>The title novella,&nbsp;<i>Goodbye, Columbus</i>, the story of a summer romance between a poor young man from Newark and a rich Radcliffe co-ed, is both a tightly wrought tale of youthful desire and a satiric gem that takes aim at the comfortable affluence of the postwar boom. Here and in the stories that accompany it, including &#x201c;The Conversion of the Jews&#x201d; and &#x201c;Defender of the Faith,&#x201d; Roth depicts Jewish lives in 1950s America with an unflinching sharpness of observation.<br><br>In&nbsp;<i>Letting Go</i>, a sprawling novel set largely against the backdrop of Chicago in the 1950s, Roth portrays the moral dilemmas of young people cast precipitously into adulthood, and in the process describes a skein of social and family responsibilities as they are brought into focus by issues of marriage, abortion, adoption, friendship, and career. The novel&#x2019;s expansiveness provides a wide scope for Roth&#x2019;s gift for vivid characterization, and in his protagonist Gabe Wallach he creates a nuanced portrait of a responsive young academic whose sense of morality draws him into the ordeals of others with unforeseen consequences.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

Of Roth's first book, Goodbye, Columbus and Five Short Stories, Saul Bellow wrote: "Unlike those of us who come howling into the world, blind and bare, Mr. Roth appears with nails, hair, teeth, speaking coherently. He is skilled, witty, energetic and performs like a virtuoso." This masterpiece of character analysis and social description is joined here by <i>Letting Go</i>, Roth's first full-length novel, a powerful and ambitious study of the youthful struggle to become independent that is also an extraordinary social tapestry of 1950s America.Philip Roth, acclaimed author of <b>Portnoy's Complaint</b>, <b>The Human Stain</b> and many other works of fiction, is the recipient of numerous awards, including the National Medal of Arts from the White House.</p><h2>Farming</h2><p>Farms are busy places throughout the year. Animals are born; fields are plowed and planted, and crops are harvested. The winters are quiet, but there are always chores to be done . . . and soon spring will come again. Here Gail Gibbons describes the activities and special qualities of life on a family farm.</p><p>Gail Gibbons &#34;has taught more preschoolers and early readers about the world than any other children&#39;s writer-illustrator,&#34; according to the Washington Post. Winner of the 2010 Regina Award, she has written and illustrated more than fifty books for Holiday House. She lives in Corinth, Vermont.Gibbons delivers what her readers have come to expect: picture books that describe real-life activities and familiar functions. Life on the farm is a mode of existence most people take for granted. Gibbons depicts aspects of that life with her characteristic bright colors and stylized forms in a conceptual space that is intended to portray not one particular farm but a universal one. Every season brings its own specific chores, indoors and out, its own crops and its own food. There are the forces of nature, and the ways the farmer harnesses or copes with the elements using mechanical devices. Despite an overuse of the passive voice ("The vegetable garden is planted . . . water is lugged . . . fields are fertilized") this is a good addition to the author's energetic how-to books.

For Gideon Lewis-Kraus, it promises a different kind of escape. Determined to avoid the kind of constraint that kept his father, a gay rabbi, closeted until midlife, he has moved to anything-goes Berlin. But the surfeit of freedom there has begun to paralyze him, and when a friend extends a drunken invitation to join him on an ancient pilgrimage route across Spain, he grabs his sneakers, glad of the chance to be committed to something and someone.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Irreverent, moving, hilarious, and thought-provoking, A Sense of Direction is Lewis-Kraus's dazzling riff on the perpetual war between discipline and desire, and its attendant casualties.

A 2007-8 Fulbright fellowship brought him to Berlin, world capital of contemporary restlessness. He has more or less settled in Brooklyn.<p><b>Prologue: Tallinn</b></p><p>My friend Tom was trapped at home in a tiny, distant city. He had no Estonian visa, and he knew if he left Tallinn he'd be unable to return. More immediately problematic was the Russian stripper he'd been flirting with, or, more specifically, her boy�friend, who had taken to hanging around Tom's front door. Tom pleaded with me to visit, confident the guy wouldn't take on the two of us.</p><p>Tom and I didn't know each other all that well then, nothing like later, but it sounded like a fun excuse for a trip. Unlike Tom, I could leave my apartment in Berlin whenever I wanted &#x2014; I had a German freelancer's visa and no cuckolded Baltic criminals camped out on my stoop &#x2014; and was, in fact, spending more time away than at home. By that point Berlin often left me feeling at loose ends, and one of the things I had come to like most about living there was how easy it was never to be in town. A lot of my friends had already moved on, had gone back to resume their real lives in New York, and I myself was beginning to wonder if it wasn't time to pack it in. It was unclear where I'd go, though, mostly because no�where was more appealing than Berlin had once been, should have been still. I'd been living in lovely, provincial San Francisco and had moved to Berlin because I'd felt I was missing out on something exciting, and now I was on the brink of leaving lively, provisional Berlin because I was afraid I was missing out on something serious. A quarter lifetime of anecdotal evidence suggested, however, that once I actually motivated myself to move somewhere I considered serious, somewhere like New York &#x2014; where I had never actually lived for very long but where, I imagined, I would find myself ready to get on with the routines and attachments that make for a real life (cat, yoga, a relationship) &#x2014; I would once again regret missing all the novelty diverting people elsewhere. Maybe not New York, then. Maybe Kiev. I'd heard Kiev was cheap and cool. I often reminded myself to look into it.</p><p>Tom and I held in common the hope that there might be a geo�graphic ticket out of the problems of indecision, boredom, and the sus�picion that more interesting things were happening in more fashionable places to more attractive people. Actually, that last part was my worry; in Tom's version, less interesting things were happening in contemplative places to more industrious people. Tom had moved to Tallinn with the idea he'd be pressed into productivity there, that the constraint of its distance and exoticism would force him to focus on the work he'd been neglecting in favor of video games and the more dissipated varieties of recreation. I'd moved to Berlin precisely for its lack of constraint, hoping that its sense of vast possibility would help me figure out what I wanted. Needless to say, for reasons that went beyond Russian strippers, it wasn't really working out for either of us. Tom's claustrophobia left him desperate for distraction, and my distraction left me desperate for discipline. We were like two ships waiting for a breeze that might float us past each other in the night.</p><p>Tom picked me up at the tiny airport in a taxi and brought me up to date. "I was living in Saigon," he said, "and after a year I had to leave be�cause my life was spinning out of control. Then I was living in Rome, and I had to leave after six months because my life was spinning out of con�trol. Then I moved to Las Vegas, and I had to leave there, too, very quickly, because my life was definitely once again spinning out of control."</p><p>"You were having trouble keeping yourself together in Rome, so you moved to Vegas?"</p><p>"So I left Vegas and I thought to myself, okay, I need to finish this long-overdue book, so I'll go to a small, distant country with an impos�sible language and I'll just sit and write all day until the book is done. I came here."</p><p>He looked out the window at the looming medieval spires of the old town, where he was paying Manhattan rent to live in the lavishly restored fourteenth century. "And now I can say, with utter confidence, that my life is spinning out of control."</p><p>I hadn't known Tom long enough to presume to tell him how to live. Besides, he was a successful writer I admired and had long wished I might one day resemble. He was only six years older than me, not quite enough to make him a paternal figure but enough to make him a guide, and I preferred to think of him as somewhat more together than he liked to suggest. I assumed that despite his life's apparent mismanagement there must be some greater logic to it. Plus he was living out a somewhat distorted but still recognizable version of my own fantasy: skipping club lines with future Baltic dictators, then until-dawn depravity with minor Baltic celebrities. The best thing I could do for him, I decided, was to provide him with company and reverence.</p><p>What I chiefly remember about the four-day jag that followed is wak�ing up in my bed, peering at my uncharacteristically unread email, and realizing that I was back in Berlin. I had vague recollections of sitting in an idling cab outside a Soviet-era tower block on the outskirts of Tallinn, and of spending an evening in the company of some Siberian dancers and the man being groomed to lead Estonia's next nationalist front, and of gazing through a bobbing porthole at some gray sea while Tom let his forehead cool against a Formica table. I looked at my camera to discover a few blurry images of what I have come to believe was probably Helsinki. The only other clue was a page in my little notebook, where I'd managed one note in four days: "Camino de Santiago &#x2014; sense of purpose &#x2014; June 10." I'd underlined "purpose."</p><p>This Camino business sounded vaguely familiar. The internet duti�fully reported that in the year A.D. 813, the alleged bones of the apostle St. James the Greater were unearthed in Santiago de Compostela, in far northwestern Spain. St. James had supposedly evangelized as far afield as Galicia &#x2014; unlikely, Tom says &#x2014; before he was martyred in first-century Palestine. His relics were said to have arrived at the Atlantic coast, then the presumed end of the world, in a stone boat, where they remained buried under a hermitage until their discovery eight centuries later. A pilgrimage to the site started up within the next hundred years, probably along the old trail of a pagan death cult. (The Iberian Celts walked to the end of the earth to watch the sun perish nightly into the sea.) Around 1140 the Codex Calixtinus appeared, a book that's part how-to and part spiritual advice, and that has come to be regarded as the world's first travel guide &#x2014; the route is also credited with the invention of the souve�nir tchotchke &#x2014; and since that time the Camino de Compostela has seen a more or less continuous parade of redemptive aspiration. Over the past twenty years, in no small part thanks to the efforts of a dopey German television comedian, the pilgrimage has become popular with a secular crowd. It's about nine hundred kilometers, or a little less than six hundred miles, depending on where you start and whether you continue to the sea, and takes most people about a month to walk.</p><p>The book Tom had moved to Estonia to work on was a record of his visits to the far-flung tombs of the apostles, and by the time I was done reading up on the Camino, which had an immediate appeal for reasons I only dimly understood, I'd retrieved a faint memory of Tom's having said he planned to spend the following summer strolling across Spain, starting on the French side of the Pyrenean border. I didn't know what to make of my "June 10" note, though, so I called him up on Skype. He hadn't slept since I'd left, but he sounded chipper, happy to hear from me.</p><p>"I miss you, man," he said. "I'm lonely again and wish you were still around."</p><p>"Me, too, buddy." I paused. "So, Tom, what's going on June 10?"</p><p>"That's the day we start," he said. "It worked with both of our schedules."</p><p>I had no schedule to speak of, so I couldn't argue with that. Then again, neither did he. The notion of something working with our sched�ules made me suspicious.</p><p>"The day we start what, Tom?"</p><p>"Our walk across Spain. You don't remember? Strolling through hills by night, just you and me and the long path ahead. I told you any ho�tels we stay in are on me. You had that whole rousing speech about how we'd wake up each morning full of the simple, broad purpose of moving forward. You pounded your fist on the table and shouted to the whole bar that you were one hundred percent in. A few Estonians even clapped, though maybe they were just trying to get you to be quiet. Then we prom�ised some girls we'd send them postcards from Santiago."</p></p><h2>Spirit Walker: Poems by Nancy Wood</h2><p>The courage, determination, and powerful spiritual faith of native Americans are celebrated in this remarkable collection. Nancy Wood&#39;s eloquent poems reveal the unique wisdom and vision of a people who have been her friends and teachers for more than thirty years.frank Howell&#39;s magnificent paintings evoke the beauty and vitality of their ancient culture. Poetry and paintings together creata a haunting portrait of a proud and enduring people whose great love and respect for the earth are valuable examples for us all.</p><p>A companion to Many Winters (1974), this collection of 40-odd poems (several previously published) and a few prose pieces is also based on the legends, values, and beliefs of the Taos Pueblo Indians and restates many of the same themes: the interconnectedness of the earth and all beings, cycles of death and regeneration, the conflict of material and spiritual values, the strength of women. The poetry has become more ``literary''; the illustrations--without the particularity of the earlier portraits- -show archetypical Native Americans with extravagantly flowing hair afloat on fields of intense color. Both poems and paintings are beautiful in their way, but their mannerism is no match for the concreteness and immediacy of the earlier work.

But indeed the heart and soul of Neil Gaiman's magnum opus lies here in <i>Brief Lives</i>. It could be because one of the most central mysteries--that of the Sandman's missing brother--is revealed here (in fact, the plot of this volume is the search for this member of the Endless). It could be because everything that comes after this volume, however surprising or unexpected, is inevitable. But it's more because this is a story about mortality and loss, the difficulty of change, the purpose of remembering, the purpose of forgetting, and the importance of humanity. If you have wanted to find out what all the good buzz on this great comic book series is about and haven't read any Gaiman before, don't be turned off by this volume's pivotal position in the larger story of the Sandman series. This book might actually operate better as a stand-alone story, in that its depth and compassion are more condensed, pure, and brief. --<i>Jim Pascoe</i>Gaiman's very popular Sandman series (this is the eighth book in the series) continues with another tale of the Endless, the family of mythic cosmic beings that govern the psychic and physical realms of Dream, Desire, Despair, Destiny, Delirium, Destruction and Death. Morpheus, Lord of Dreams and the central figure in the series, is asked by his sister, the unstable and touchingly demented Delirium, to help locate their brother Destruction. Destruction abandoned his duties 300 years ago (about the time of the Enlightenmentnt), dropping out of sight after a prescient and despairing glimpse of the rise of human reason and its own destructive proclivities. The grimly ironic Morpheus and his whimsically erratic sister travel among the mortals of earth in search of their brother and ultimately learn something of Destruction's reasons for abdicating. Gaiman's works often follow the plots of classical and mythical narratives and Brief Lives, like his other works, can often look and sound as ponderous as a bad period costume movie. But his works are also driven by sharply drawn characters and his knack for capturing the patterns of intimacy, even in an otherworldly setting, can be affecting. Thompson and Locke contribute subtle and vividly colored drawings, rendered in an awkward but agile line. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Lady</h2><p>A young man is befriended by a gracious woman and comes to know the joys and tragedies of her life</p><p></p><h2>Skip�Beat!, Vol. 13 (13)</h2><p>� An ongoing manga series in Japan&#x2014;over 14 volumes to date<br>� Consistent ranking in Japan&#x2019;s Top 10 manga sales<br>� An American Idol-style manga<br>� Every new volume has appeared in Japan&#x2019;s Tohan Top 1<br>� Previewed and promoted in VIZ Media&#x2019;s Shojo Beat magazine<br>� Released Bi-monthly (every other month).<br><br>Kyoko Mogami followed her true love Sho to Tokyo to support him while he made it big as an idol.

Col. James Cushing and His Filipino Guerrillas Captured Japan's Plan Z</h2><p>This work reveals one of the most important intelligence triumphs of World War II. It was no less than the capture of Japan&#x2019;s &#x201c;Plan Z&#x201d;&#x2014;the Empire&#x2019;s fully detailed strategy for prosecuting the last stages of the Pacific War. It&#x2019;s a story of happenstance, mayhem, and intrigue, and resulted directly in the spectacular U.S. victory in the Philippine Sea and MacArthur&#x2019;s early return to Manila, doubtless shortening WWII by months.<br><br>One night in April 1944, Admiral Koga (successor to Yamamoto), commander-in-chief of Japanese forces in the Pacific, took off in a seaplane to establish new headquarters. For security reasons he had his chief-of-staff, Rear Admiral Fukudome, fly in a separate seaplane. But both aircraft ran into a tremendous typhoon and were knocked out of the skies. Koga&#x2019;s plane crashed with the loss of all hands. Fukudome&#x2019;s crashlanded into the sea off Cebu, the Philippines, and both the admiral and the precious Japanese war plans floated ashore.<br><br>Lt. Col. James M. Cushing was an American mining engineer who happened to be in Cebu when war broke out in the Pacific. He soon took charge of the local guerrillas and became a legendary leader. But his most spectacular exploit came when he captured Admiral Fukudome and the &#x201c;Plan Z&#x201d; that was in his tow. The result was a ferocious cat-and-mouse game between Cushing&#x2019;s guerrillas and the Japanese occupation forces. While Cushing desperately sent out messages to MacArthur to say what he had found, the Japanese scoured the entire countryside, killing hundreds of civilians in a full-scale attempt to retrieve their loss.<br><br>Cushing finally traded the admiral in return for a cessation of civilian deaths&#x2014;but he still secretly retained the Japanese war plans. Naturally both Tokyo and Washington tried to cover up what was happening at the time&#x2014;neither wanted the other to know what they&#x2019;d lost, or what they&#x2019;d found. However, in this book we finally learn of the huge intelligence coup by Lt. Col. Cushing that helped to shorten the entire war.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>PREFACE<br>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS<br><br>PART ONE: THE PACIFIC ON FIRE <br>PROLOGUE: THE ORIGINS OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR<br>1 THE OTSU INCIDENT<br>2 JOINING THE GOLD RUSH<br>3 THE MAGIC OF CEBU<br>4 SITUATION UNTENABLE<br>5 THE HUNT FOR PLAN Z<br>6 JAPAN AND WORLD WAR II<br>7 UNDER ATTACK!<br>8 THE AMERICAN SURRENDER<br>9 THE JAPANESE OCCUPATION OF CEBU<br><br>PART TWO: GUERRILLA WARFARE IN CEBU, PHILIPPINES<br>10 THE BIRTH OF A GUERRILLA ARMY<br>11 TABUNAN<br>12 JAPANESE COUNTERATTACKS<br>13 GUERRILLA WARFARE IN THE PHILIPPINES<br>14 THE BATTLE FOR TABUNAN<br>15 THE STRUGGLE FOR RECOGNITION<br><br>PART THREE: THE Z-PLAN<br>16 THE CODE BREAKERS<br>17 THE DOCUMENTS THAT CHANGED THE WAR IN THE PACIFIC<br>18 PLAN Z IN AMERICAN HANDS<br>19 GENERAL DOUGLAS MACARTHUR AND THE PHILIPPINES<br>20 PLANNING THE RETURN<br>21 &#x201c;I HAVE RETURNED&#x201d;<br>22 THE LIBERATION OF CEBU<br>PART FOUR: EPILOGUE<br>23 THE END OF WORLD WAR II<br>24 THE OTSU INCIDENT IN HINDSIGHT<br>25 LIEUTENANT COLONEL JAMES M.

Cushing&#x2019;s Coup is one of those books...reveals the serendipitous discovery and savvy exploitation of the intelligence coup of the naval plans of the Imperial Japanese Navy for 1944, demonstrating the importance of intelligence to the prosecution of the Allied effort during the Pacific War, and how that intelligence depended on little-known and poorly remembered people on the ground like Lt. Col. James Cushing and his local guerrillas of Cebu. Also of great interest, besides the value of this work in the larger place of World War II historiography, is the attention paid to areas of political, diplomatic, and logistical skill, a vivid portrayal of the difficulties of guerrilla and anti-insurgent combat, and also the difficulties faced by war heroes in being remembered when their service has taken place in what are now post-colonial regimes.

She died in 1978, at the age of eighty-four, in her longtime home, the village of Maiden Newton in Dorset, England.These 20 uncollected stories by Warner, who died in 1978, first appeared in the New Yorker over the course of five decades. There is a timeless quality about the collection as a whole; Warner's drollery and wit has lost nothing in the passage of time. At the center are five stories involving the urbane Mr. Edom, proprietor of Abbey Antique Galleries. In the first, "A Flying Start," he is unexpectedly elated when a young woman asserts herself by stealing a locket that her husband (a good customer) has refused to buy for her. "English Mosaic" tells how Mr. Edom gets rid of an unbearable assistant by skillfully finding her a romantic interest. In "The Listening Woman," Mr. Edom's assistant, Mr. Collins, shows he has learned well from his employer; he quotes an outrageously high price on an object to get rid of a potential buyer and to allow it to be purchased by an old woman who has a sentimental attachment to it. Other outstanding stories include "The Inside-Out," where a character introduced at the very end, usually an unfortunate plot device, brings everything together and allows the reader to understand what has gone before. Throughout these stories, there are remarkable descriptions of houses, interiors, gardens and natural phenomena, and the use of sight, sound, taste, touch and smell is extraordinary. "The trees were heavy with summer, pigeons cooed all day, and a continuous mild buzz of insects filled the woods with a sound of piety." The time is ripe for a reappreciation of Warner, whose much beloved morality fable Lolly Willowes was reissued in 1999 as part of the New York Review of Books Classics Series.

It's just as accurate to say I'm a career collaborator. That is, I identify problems, organize them, and solve them by working with others. Many of the stories I'll be telling involve the world of dance, but you don't have to know anything about dance to get the point. Work is work. </p><p> I define collaboration as people working together -- sometimes by choice, sometimes not. Sometimes we collaborate to jump-start creativity; other times the focus is simply on getting things done. In each case, people in a good collaboration accomplish more than the group's most talented members could achieve on their own. </p><p> Here's a classic example of someone who identified a problem and worked with others to solve it. The year was 1962. The problem was a new play, <i>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</i>. The collaborator was Jerome Robbins, the choreographer and director who later became my good friend and coworker. </p><p> As <i>A Funny Thing</i> was completing its pre-Broadway tour, no one was laughing. Not Stephen Sondheim, who wrote the music and lyrics. Not veteran director George Abbott. Certainly not producer Hal Prince and the play's backers. </p><p> And, most important of all, not the audience. </p><p> At the Washington previews, just three weeks before the New York opening, audiences were fleeing the theater. By the time the curtain came down, the theater was often only half full. </p><p> And yet, on paper, <i>A Funny Thing</i> should have been a huge hit -- the creative team couldn't have been more distinguished. </p><p> What was wrong? No one knew. </p><p> What to do? That they knew. </p><p> When a show has script trouble, it's common for the producers to bring in a "play doctor." In business, he'd be called a consultant. I'd call him a collaborator -- someone who works with others to solve a problem. </p><p> The doctor they called in was Jerome Robbins, who came to Washington from Los Angeles, where he had just collected an Academy Award for <i>West Side Story</i>. He watched a performance -- and by intermission, not only had he analyzed the problem, he had a solution. </p><p> <i>A Funny Thing</i>, Robbins said, was a farce inspired by the comedies of Plautus, a Roman playwright. But Plautus lived from 254 to 184...before Christ. How many theatergoers knew who he was? Or what kind of plays he wrote? And, most of all, who knew what kind of play <i>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</i> was supposed to be? </p><p> Jerome Robbins offered simple, commonsense advice: <i>It's a comedy. Tell them that.</i> </p><p> Sondheim quickly wrote an opening number called "Comedy Tonight" -- "Something convulsive / Something repulsive / Something for everyone: a comedy tonight!" -- and once ticket buyers knew what they were supposed to do, they laughed. The New York reviews were cheers for an "uninhibited romp," and <i>A Funny Thing</i> played 964 performances on Broadway before going off to Hollywood and becoming a hit movie. </p><p> Clearly, it's a good idea to tell people what to expect. </p><p> Here's what you can expect from this book: a field guide to a lot of the issues that surface when you are working in a collaborative environment. I'll explain why collaboration is important to me -- and, I'll bet, to you. I'll show you how to recognize good candidates to work with and how you build a successful collaboration -- and I'll share what it feels like to be trapped in a dysfunctional one. And, finally, although this isn't a book that promises to help you find love or deepen your romantic life, I suspect that some of what you may learn from these pages can help you in your personal relationships. In each case, because collaboration isn't an airy concept but a practice that's found in our daily reality, I'll be light on ideas and heavy on stories. </p><p> Collaboration is how most of our ancestors used to work and live, before machines came along and fragmented society. </p><p> Time to plant the fields? Everybody pitched in and got it done. Harvesttime? The community raced to get the crops in before the rains came. Where were those crops stored? In barns built by teams of neighbors. </p><p> In the cities, the same spirit applied. Anonymous craftsmen spent their lives building cathedrals that wouldn't be completed for generations. Michelangelo is celebrated for the Sistine Chapel; in fact, he supervised a dozen unacknowledged assistants. Even one of the greatest composers, Johann Sebastian Bach, chose to deflect credit for his compositions, writing at the bottom of each of his pieces "SDG," for <i>Soli Deo Gloria</i> -- to God alone the glory. </p><p> By the twentieth century, only a few self-isolated sects practiced the collaborative tradition. Blame it on wars that killed millions, the atomic bomb, Freud, or any combination of factors you choose -- there's no shortage of reasons. The result is that most of us grew up in a culture that applauded only individual achievement. We are, each of us, generals in an ego-driven "army of one," each the center of an absurd cosmos, taking such happiness as we can find. Collaboration? Why bother? You only live once; grab whatever you can. </p><p> But now more and more of us are realizing that the brilliant CEO, the politician who keeps his own counsel, and the lone hero are yesterday's role models. The media may still love them, but our new heroes are men and women who know how to gather allies, build teams, and work together toward shared goals. Name an enterprise, and you'll find levels of collaboration that were unthinkable just a few years ago. The real success stories of our time are about joint efforts: sports teams, political campaigns, businesses, causes. </p><p> Collaboration is the buzzword of the new millennium. </p><p> Like many of you, I went to school when victory meant raising your hand first and shouting out the answer -- school was a war zone that rewarded only the brightest and most aggressive. But now learning is collaborative; children work together in groups to solve problems. They solve them faster this way, and without winners or losers. And in doing so, they gain valuable life skills. </p><p> Consider the Internet, which has dramatically increased our ability to communicate with friends and associates -- and millions of strangers around the world. Now we can form networks and create collaborations without start-up money, an infrastructure, or even an office. Result? Our basic urge to work in groups can be realized more easily now than at any time in modern history. </p><p> Thanks to the Internet, a battered economy, and a profound shift in personal values, a notion that was once heresy -- that the wisdom of a smart group is greater than the brainpower of its smartest member -- is increasingly accepted in every discipline and every profession and at every age and stage of life. </p><p> On the Internet, someone posts an article, then others comment. With the addition of new facts and points of view, readers benefit -- and by contributing to the conversation, they become part of a smart community. </p><p> <b>In business, "crowdsourcing" -- assigning a task that used to be done by a single worker to whole communities -- has become a powerful tool in the product-development process.</b> </p><p> Dell Computers, for example, created an outreach called IdeaStorm to get ideas and feedback from customers. So far, the company has used almost three hundred of their suggestions -- keyboards that light up in the dark, more color choices, longer battery life -- in its new products. </p><p> Starbucks has launched a Web site called My Starbucks Idea to gather consumer brainstorms, filter them through management, and then have the coffee company's customers vote on the best ones. The site has collected seventy thousand suggestions. </p><p> <b>In politics, the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama proved that the most powerful word in his slogan, "Yes we can," was <i>we</i>.</b> </p><p> Until 2008, most politicians used the Internet only for fund-raising. Barack Obama, a former community organizer, saw that "social networking" could mean more than the exchange of trivial blasts of personal information by virtual "friends." And he used the Web to build a movement that transformed interest into participation. </p><p> Obama's site had double the traffic of opponent John McCain's. Four times as many visitors to YouTube watched Obama's videos. He had five times as many Facebook "friends." Three million people signed up for his text messages -- and he sent them fifteen to twenty a month. And in the last four days of the campaign, Obama campaign volunteers made three million personal phone calls. </p><p> Experts say that no political campaign, no matter how well funded, could generate that much content on its own. Obama's core Internet team consisted of just eleven people. The rest of the work was done by highly committed supporters who took the communication devices they used every day and repurposed them to rally their personal networks for a common cause. </p><p> <b>In sports it has always been about the team.</b> </p><p> Michael Jordan started winning scoring titles in 1986. But the Chicago Bulls were not winning championships. Bulls Coach Phil Jackson knew why: "Scoring champions don't win championships." The team brought in some stronger players. And although Michael Jordan was already recognized as the greatest player in the history of basketball, he started moving the ball around. In 1991, the Bulls won their first championship in franchise history. That year, Jordan was voted the most valuable player in the finals in part because he scored thirty points in the deciding game -- but also because, in the same game, he passed the ball to teammates for ten assists. </p><p> You are probably not a professional basketball player or a politician or the proprietor of an Internet news site. You probably don't run a high-tech company or make educational policy for a school district. But in the last few years, you've certainly been exposed to the noti...</p></p><h2>Super Brain: Unleashing the Explosive Power of Your Mind to Maximize Health, Happiness, and Spiritual Well-Being</h2><p>A manual for relating to the brain in a revolutionary new way,&nbsp;<i>Super Brain&nbsp;</i>shows you how to use your brain as a gateway for achieving health, happiness, and spiritual growth.

Deepak Chopra. M.D. is the author of more than sixty-five books, including numerous <i>New York Times</i> Bestsellers. His medical training is in internal medicine and endocrinology. Rudolph E. Tanzi, Ph.D., is the Joseph P. and Rose F. Kennedy Professor of Neurology at Harvard University and director of Genetics and Aging Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital.</p> <p><strong>Q. How would you define super brain?</strong></p> <p>A. It's the brain you have now but maximized. Everyone uses the brain at every moment, but we use it unconsciously. We let it run in the background without realizing the power we have to reshape the brain. When you begin to exercise your power, the everyday brain, which we call the baseline brain, starts to move in the direction of super brain.</p> <p><strong>Q. The power to reshape the brain&#x2014;can you be more specific?</strong></p> <p>A. It means being more mindful of your own thoughts and feelings and becoming more proactive in taking charge of your brain. Each of us plays four roles in relation to the brain. We lead, we inspire, we invent, and we use it. Most people do not actively use their brains. They passively let their feelings and thoughts control their lives. Or they only use their brains without giving it much inspiration or leadership. They don't invent new ways to use their brains, either, settling instead for the same routine and repetitive thoughts every day. But if you master all four roles, you create your super brain. The bottom line isthat you when you are the active observer of your feelings and thoughts, you become the user of your brain. Your super brain then serves you, not vice versa.</p> <p><strong>Q. How did you hit upon this power to create super brain?</strong></p> <p>A. Directly from breakthroughs in neuroscience. Modern brain-scan technology has revealed that each person shapes a completely unique brain. Other studies have documented the amazing regenerative ability of the brain, which can be reshaped by the power of your mind to bring you the world you desire. Knowing that, the obvious question arose: Why not use your mind to create the brain you want, using conscious choice?</p> <p><strong>Q. What does that mean on a practical basis?</strong></p> <p>A. We give a lot of pointers in the book, but the quickest answer is this: All experiences are either positive for your brain or negative. If you maximize the positive ones, you are shaping the brain you want to being you the world you want.</p> <p><strong>Q. Can you give a few examples of what you call"a positive lifestyle for the brain"?</strong></p> <p>A. We divide it into inner work and outerwork. Outer work includes diet, exercise, stress management, social engagement, intellectual stimulation, and good sleep&#x2014;very familiar advice, but we have made it specific for the brain. Inner work is even more important and little understood until now.</p> <p><strong>Q. Can you describe inner work?</strong></p> <p>A. The brain is a dynamic system that constantly processes and creates your reality. It works best if you balance all the things that the brain is good at. The brain is good at being adaptable, flexible, creative, and intelligent. But it's also good at playing and just being. A balanced life provides time&#x2014;every day if possible&#x2014;so that every function of the brain is allowed to come alive and flourish.</p> <p><strong>Q. Do you think that "work" might be more than many people want to do?</strong></p> <p>A. By work, we mean doing the best you can for yourself. If you want lifelong good health, intact memory, reduced risk of Alzheimer's, and inner fulfillment, your brain plays the central part in all of them. The old adage of "use it or lose it" applies to the brain. The "work" is actually quite simple but requires persistence. One must simply choose to be the observer of the thoughts and feelings brought to them by their brain and use them to create a positive and constructive world that best suits them.</p> <p><strong>Q. Where is super brain taking us in the future?</strong></p> <p>A. We believe that super brain is the next evolutionary leap for the human brain. The last leap was the neocortex, the higher intellectual brain, which gave humans the ability to reason, to plan ahead, to love, to feel compassion and empathy, to attribute meaning to the world. Now we can build on that. Choice is the key, because human beings are the only creatures who can choose to evolve, who can shape their destiny. Furthermore, we have been given the gift of "self-awareness," which allows us to step back into our true selves to observe and use our brains to create the world we wish to live in. For us, super brain is the future and starts now. </p>Deepak Chopra, MD, is the author of more than 65 books including numerous&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers. &nbsp;His medical training is in internal medicine and endocrinology and he&nbsp;is a Fellow of the American College of Physicians, a member of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and&nbsp;a Senior Scientist at the Gallup organization.<br><br> Rudolph E.

They were American colonists who had volunteered for a secret mission to paddle and march nearly two hundred miles through some of the wildest country in the colonies and seize the fortress city of Quebec, the last British stronghold in Canada. <br><br>The march, under the command of Colonel Benedict Arnold, proved to be a tragic journey. Before they reached the outskirts of Quebec, hundreds died from hypothermia, drowning, small pox, lightning strikes, exposure, and starvation. The survivors ate dogs, shoes, clothing, leather, cartridge boxes, shaving soap, and lip salve. Their trek toward Quebec was nearly twice the length shown on their maps. In the midst of the journey, the most unlikely of events befell them: a hurricane. The rains fell in such torrents that their boats floated off or sunk, taking their meager provisions along, and then it began to snow. The men woke up frozen in their tattered clothing. One third of the force deserted, returning to Massachusetts. Of those remaining, more than four hundred were killed, wounded, or taken prisoner. <br><br>Finally, in the midst of a raging blizzard, those remaining attacked Quebec. In the assault, their wet muskets failed to fire. Undaunted, they overtook the first of two barricades and pressed on toward the other, nearly taking Canada from the British. Demonstrating Benedict Arnold's prowess as a military strategist, the attack on Quebec accomplished another goal for the colonial army: It forced the British to commit thousands of troops to Canada, subsequently weakening the British hand against George Washington. <br><br>A great military history about the early days of the American Revolution, <i>Through a Howling Wilderness</i> is also a timeless adventure narrative that tells of heroic acts, men pitted against nature's fury, and a fledgling nation's fight against a tyrannical oppressor.<br><br></p><p>Thomas A. Desjardin is the Historic Site Specialist for the State of Maine. He is the author of <i>Stand Firm, Ye Boys from Maine: The 20th Maine and the Gettysburg Campaign</i> and <i>These Honored Dead: How the Story of Gettysburg Shaped American Memory.</i><br><br>Chapter One<br><br><i>The Fourteenth Colony<br></i><br>He came within view of his father's house a little past noon on a pleasant late-September day. Eighteen months had passed since he had left this home in Bridgewater of the Colony of Massachusetts to join the army of George Washington, and in that time he had taken part in adventures and hardships that people in his hometown only read about in novels---those that could read and had time for novels. During his service he had fought at Bunker Hill, then sailed to the Province of Maine with an army under Colonel Benedict Arnold, walked, waded, and swam hundreds of miles through the Maine wilderness to the city of Quebec.<br><br>Along the way this simple farmer watched men around him die of hypothermia, drowning, and drunken violence. Smallpox, and falling trees killed his fellow soldiers. He saw friends die from exposure and exhaustion, from starvation and from eating too quickly after starvation. To survive, men ate dogs, shoes, clothing, leather, cartridge boxes, shaving soap, tree sap, and lip salve. If they survived, they suffered from gout, rheumatism, dysentery, angina, distemper, diarrhea, constipation, pneumonia, swollen limbs, and infestation.<br><br>With the comrades who survived, he attacked a naturally fortified city that contained a military force larger than their own, made up of soldiers from the most powerful empire the world had ever known. When the attack failed, he was captured and thrown into a dungeonlike British prison where he nearly perished from smallpox. He was then pressed into service on a British ship for months, until he, along with two other comrades, escaped and walked back through the Maine wilderness, hundreds of miles, to civilization. On the return trip, they encountered the bones of the men who had died on the way to Quebec the year before. Back among colonial villages, they sailed as laborers on a vessel bound for Boston, a few days walk from Bridgewater.<br><br>Now, as he approached the comforts and safety of home, he little resembled the fresh-faced teenager who had left to fight for the Rebel cause just after Lexington-Concord. His trials had left him haggard, his skin pitted by smallpox, and his appearance greatly altered. Unconscious of the effect his sudden and gaunt appearance might have on his loved ones, he simply entered through the open door, nodded his head, and sat down in a chair just inside without uttering a word. His mother was across the room sewing and looked up when he entered, but, thinking he was a passing stranger stopping for rest or refreshment, she went back to her needlework without even a greeting.<br><br>His young sister, not yet a teenager, took note of him next and, with the curiosity of a youngster, eyed him closely for a time. Suddenly she exclaimed "La, if there ain't Simon!"<br><br>At this his mother, who had given him up for dead months earlier, nearly fainted, and as the news of his return spread through the countryside, his father and brother came to confirm the rumor. That evening, friends from miles around came to the modest home to hear his stories of great adventure and suffering. Simon Fobes was home from the war and had a tale to tell of one of the greatest military expeditions in American history.<br><br>Quebec City had been the hub of civilization in its region since Samuel de Champlain first sailed up the St. Lawrence River in 1603. Here he encountered a native settlement on a prominent hill of solid rock that lay between the fork made by the St. Lawrence and one of its major tributaries. The Algonquins who used the site called it "Kebec," meaning "where the river narrows," and it must have struck Champlain as a natural and ideal base of operation for future exploration and colonization. The high rock slope rising from the rivers made it a site one could easily defend against attack, while the half-dozen rivers that converged into the St. Lawrence within ten miles made it ideal for transportation of trade goods and supplies to and from the surrounding wilderness. Even this far inland, the deep waters of the St. Lawrence provided easy access to the sea and Europe. In subsequent voyages, Champlain inquired about Quebec of the natives he encountered elsewhere, and he learned that its trading potential stretched nearly as far as he explored, all the way to the southern coast of Maine.<br><br>Two years later, he sailed to Maine's Penobscot Bay and up the navigable length of its river to what is now Bangor. There he learned from the natives that one could reach Quebec by way of a series of lakes, "and, when they reach the end, they go some distance by land, and afterward enter a little river which flows into the St. Lawrence."<br> <br>The following year he learned of yet another route, farther west, by way of the Kennebec River. "One can go from this river across the land so far as Quebec," he recalled, "some 50 leagues, without passing more than one portage of two leagues. Then one enters another little river which empties into the great River St. Lawrence."<br> <br>This was the first time any white man ever heard of what would later be known as the Kennebec-Chaudi�re trail, though the natives apparently failed to mention the difficulties that lay along this path.<br><br>Convinced of the potential of the Quebec site, in 1608 Champlain led a group of thirty-two colonists to settle there and establish it as a trading center, primarily for furs. Only nine colonists survived their first Canadian winter, but the colony endured, and more settlers arrived the following summer. For the next century and a half, the citadel at Quebec was a focal point of fighting between the British and French empires until 1759, when the city fell into English hands after the pivotal Battle of the Plains of Abraham.<br><br>The generals commanding each side in this fight, Montcalm for the French and Wolfe for the British, died in the fighting, and the British seized the city. By 1761, fighting in the so-called French and Indian Wars had dwindled to a close, and the two European powers signed a formal peace treaty in Paris on February 10, 1763. By this agreement, France relinquished all of its claims to North America, leaving tens of thousands of French settlers in Quebec Province subject to British rule.<br><br>Eleven years after the Treaty of Paris solidified England's authority over the province, the British Parliament passed what became known as the Quebec Act of 1774, instituting a permanent administration in Canada by replacing the temporary English-style government created in 1763 with a French form of civil law, while maintaining the British system of criminal law. In addition, it gave French Canadians complete religious freedom---a direct threat, as the other colonies saw it, "to dispose the inhabitants to act with hostility against the free Protestant Colonies, whenever a wicked Ministry shall chuse so to direct them."<br> <br>Representatives of the lower thirteen colonies soon listed it among the so-called Intolerable Acts, about which they pled with King George for relief. When he ignored their plea, they turned to open rebellion.<br><br>By the mid-1770s, Champlain's Quebec had grown into a huge province stretching to the Mississippi River and including modern-day Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. It was home to eighty thousand inhabitants, though only 2 percent of them spoke English. Despite its official status as a North American colony under British rule, Quebec never became a part of the coalition of colonies that eventually declared their independence in 1776. Language and religious differences set the Qu�becois well apart from their neighbors to the south, and when representatives of the lower thirteen colonies met at the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia in 1774, no delegate from Quebec answered the roll. As the Protestant colonies then saw it, Catholic Quebec existed "to the great danger, from so great a dissimilarity of Religion, law, and government, of the neighboring British colonies by the assistance of whose blood and treasure the said country was conquered from France."<br><br>Once fighting had broken out between colonists and soldiers of the Crown, however, some in the lower thirteen began to see the advantages of enlisting the fourteenth colony to the north. Aside from alleviating the danger they felt from their northern neighbors, gaining the support of eighty thousand French, who were predisposed to British-hating anyway, could create a decided advantage in their designs against the mother country. At the very least, removing the British strongholds at Quebec and Montreal would eliminate any threat against the colonies from that region, effectively quashing British attempts to open a northern front in the newly begun conflict from which it could march an army south and cut the colonies in half.<br><br>If there was to be a fourteenth colony in the struggle against England, those in favor of it would find an obstacle in their way that would prove to be even more formidable than the high stone walls of Quebec. Governor Guy Carleton had returned to Quebec City from London in 1774 having married, become a father twice over, and seen to the passage of the act the colonists were then listing among the intolerable. Carleton's Quebec Act allowed the Qu�becois to worship as Catholics even though this was illegal in England itself. It also retained the French system of land tenure, and even let them speak French while serving in public offices. This was a remarkable feat for the governor, since it showed not only his understanding of his subjects and how best to placate them, but also his ability to persuade the British Parliament to go to such unusual lengths to do so. With the same stroke, Carleton had also seen his dominion of Quebec expand westward all the way to the Mississippi River.<br><br>However it was that Carleton swayed Parliament to grant him such requests, it certainly had nothing to do with his personal charm, which he seemed to lack altogether. Cold and aloof, he was, as an officer who served under him once wrote, "one of the most distant, reserved men in the world; he has a rigid strictness in his manner very unpleasing and which he observes even to his most particular friends and acquantances [sic]." Even General James Wolfe, hardly a model of good humor himself but one of the governor's closest friends, described him as "grave Carleton."<br><br>Still, he was considered the very model of an eighteenth-century British officer. At fifty years of age, he was six feet tall, with a high forehead that his hairline seemed to have largely abandoned. Born in Ireland to English gentry, he joined the British Army as an ensign in 1742, during the War of Austrian Succession. He later served as Wolfe's quartermaster general and chief engineer during the campaign that ended, along with Wolfe's life, on the Plains of Abraham, when the British seized Quebec from the French in 1759. He was wounded two years afterward, leading an assault against the French island of Belle-�le off the Brittany coast, and again the following year, assaulting Morro Castle in Havana, Cuba.<br><br>Carleton was active and energetic in his work, and King George III once wrote that his "uncorruptness is universally acknowledged." <br> <br>Years later, a soldier under his command at Quebec would say, "There is not perhaps in the world a more experienced or more determined officer than General Carleton."<br> <br>In 1766, with the help of his benefactor the Duke of Richmond, Carleton gained the King's appointment as lieutenant governor of Quebec and brigadier general in America. Two years later, King George elevated him to governor.<br><br>Returning from London in 1774, Carleton was well aware of the rebellion brewing in the other American colonies, and he hoped that his work with Parliament back home would pay dividends in Quebec. As a rule, the French inhabitants warmly received the news of the Quebec Act and its concessions to their religion and law.<br><br>In September 1774, Carleton sent two regiments to Massachusetts to help with the unrest there. This severely depleted his defensive forces at Quebec, where he found the Qu�becois ambivalent about the city's defense, and the French idea of employing Native Americans out of the question. Carleton winced at the brutality shown by natives toward colonists, including innocent civilians, and he "would not even suffer a Savage to pass the Frontier [into the lower colonies], though often urged to let them loose on the Rebel Provinces, lest cruelties might have been committed, and for fear the innocent might have suffered with the Guilty."<br> <br>In addition, the boiling cauldron of insurrection in the lower colonies meant that he would get no help from London. In the summer of 1775, he wrote to a friend, "The situation of the King's affairs in [Massachusetts] leaves no room in the present moment for any consideration [other] than that . . . of augmenting the army under general Gage [in Boston]."<br><br>On May 19, 1775, a month-old letter arrived from General Thomas Gage stating that hostilities had broken out in Massachusetts. The following day, a courier arrived with word "that one Benedict Arnold said to be a native of Connecticut and a Horse Jockey" had led five hundred colonists in taking British outposts at Ticonderoga and Crown Point and had even penetrated to Saint Jean, within the boundaries of Quebec Province. It was not the last Carleton would hear of this horse jockey.<br><br>Down in the troubled and troublesome Colony of Massachusetts, the shooting at Lexington and Concord had shifted the disagreements with the King from political to military in April. A growing colonial force had fought at Bunker Hill against the British in June, and though the King's soldiers could claim a narrow victory in the fight, the colonists had shown that they were something more effective than an organized mob. As a result, they held the British garrison in Boston under siege while volunteers and militia groups from as many as hundreds of miles away rushed to join the now swelling colonial ranks. Daniel Morgan marched his Virginia rifle company six hundred miles in twenty-one days, and Michael Cressap's Maryland company covered 550 miles in twenty-two days to join the rebellion. On July 3, General George Washington, carrying his appointment as commander-in-chief of the colonial forces from the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, arrived in Cambridge to take command.<br><br>Among those anxious to rally around the patriot cause was a prominent trader and merchant from New Haven, Connecticut, who had made his fortune sailing goods from the West Indies to ports such as New York, Boston, Montreal, and Quebec. Energetic to an extreme and often impetuous, he had graying hair by 1775, giving him an air of maturity, but at thirty-four he remained a man of unusual strength and agility. He was of average height for his time, but his steel eyes, prominent nose, and a tendency to speak in a crisp and succinct manner gave those who encountered him cause to grant an instant respect. Though he had made himself one of the wealthiest men in the Colony of Connecticut, he was not of like mind with many of the "old guard" patriarchs of New Haven, who resisted the growing disagreements with the mother country. Instead, he seemed anxious not only to witness the outbreak of military action between King and colonies, but to participate in them personally, even though it meant risking his fortune.<br><br>As political tensions grew, Arnold helped form, and was elected captain of, the Governor's Second Company of Guards. When he received news of the fighting at Lexington and Concord, he started for Cambridge to join the forces gathering there. Realizing that the colonials had little powder and almost no cannons, Arnold turned his attention to t...</p><h2>When Red is Black</h2><p><p>Praise for <i>A Loyal Character Dancer</i>:</p><p>"Another wonderful novel featuring Inspector Chen of the Shanghai Police Bureau ... for Sinophiles like myself who fantasize about taking an insider&#x2019;s tour of Shanghai."&#x2014;Maureen Corrigan, NPR, "Fresh Air," <i>Washington Post Book World</i></p><p>"A sequel [to <i>Death of a Red Heroine</i>] that in many ways is even more impressive . . .

What better way to navigate this city than through the adventures of the detectives who handle homicides and disappearances for the Special Case Squad, the unit that deals with politically sensitive crimes? Inspector Chen, a former English major, poetry lover, and dedicated gourmand, briefly steps aside here (he has a translation project taking up his vacation time) and lets his subordinate, the housing-oppressed Detective Yu, handle the murder of a dissident writer, the female author of a novel considered highly critical of the new China. This woman, who lived in a traditional Shanghai <i>shikumen </i>house, had become a social isolate in that most social of buildings. In a somewhat heavy-handed contrivance, Chen's translation project involves a proposal for a modern galleria based on the communal <i>shikumen </i>model, drawing him inevitably back into the investigation. The Chen mysteries proceed at a stately, slow pace, not unlike the meals that Chen enjoys. Plot is secondary to food, to poetry, to politics, and to Chen's highly complex character. For those with similar taste and metabolism, these are mysteries to savor. <i>Connie Fletcher</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Her first stop is her parents&#x2019; luxurious apartment, where she encounters the ghost of her long-deceased grandmother. For Madison, the encounter triggers memories of the awful summer she spent upstate with Nana Minnie and her grandfather, Papadaddy. As she revisits the painful truth of what transpired over those months (including a disturbing and finally fatal meeting in a rest stop&#x2019;s fetid men&#x2019;s room, in which . . . well, never mind), her saga of eternal damnation takes on a new and sinister meaning.

They always will. It&#x2019;s only our stories about them that ever change.<br><br>In the sixth century b.c. the Greek lawmaker Solon journeyed to the Egyptian city of Sais and brought back the following account of the end of the world. According to the priests at the temple of Neith, a cataclysm will sweep the Earth with flames and poisonous smoke. In a single day and night an entire continent will founder and sink into the sea, and a false messiah will lead all of humanity to its doom.<br><br>The Egyptian seers predicted that the Apocalypse will begin on a quiet night, on a lofty hilltop perched high above the kingdom of Los Angeles. There, the ancient oracles sing, a lock will snap open. Among the great walled houses of Beverly Crest, a stout bolt will slide aside. As recorded by Solon, a hinged pair of security gates will swing wide apart. Below these, the realms of Westwood and Brentwood and Santa Monica await, sleeping, laid out in a spider&#x2019;s web of streetlights. And as the last clock tick of midnight echoes away, within those wide-open gates will dwell only darkness and silence until an engine can be heard rumbling to life, and two lights will seem to lead that noise forward. And from out of that gateway will issue a Lincoln Town Car which slouches forth to begin its slow descent down the hairpin curves of upper Hollywood Boulevard.<br><br>That night, as depicted in ancient prophecy, is tranquil, without a breath of wind; nevertheless, with the Lincoln&#x2019;s slow progress a tempest begins to mount in its wake.<br><br>As it descends from Beverly Crest to the Hollywood Hills, the Lincoln stretches as long and black as the tongue of someone strangled by a noose. With pink smears of streetlights sliding down the burnished black shell of it, the Town Car shines like a scarab escaping a tomb. And at North Kings Road the lights of Beverly Hills and Hancock Park blink and go dark, not house by house but blocks and blocks of the grid are blotted out in their entirety. And at North Crescent Heights Boulevard, the neighborhood of Laurel Canyon is obliterated; not merely the lights but the noise and late-night music are vanquished. Any shimmering proof of the city is erased as the car flows downhill, from North Fairfax to Ogden Drive to North Gardner Street. And thus does darkness wash over the city, following in the shadow of the sleek car.<br><br>And so, too, does a brutal wind follow. As foretold by the priests of ages past, this gale makes thrashing mops of the towering palm trees along Hollywood Boulevard, and these sweep the sky. Their clashing fronds cast down horrible, soft shapes that land with screams against the pavement. With beady caviar eyes and scaly serpent tails, these fierce, soft shapes hammer the passing Town Car. They drop squealing. Their frenzied claws scratch at the air. Their slamming impacts do not break the windshield, because the glass is bulletproof. And the rolling tires of the Lincoln rumble over them, pulping their fallen flesh. And these plummeting, shrieking, clutching shapes are rats. Cast to their deaths, these are the flailing bodies of opossums. The tires of the Lincoln burst this red carpet of crushed fur. The windshield wipers clear the driver&#x2019;s view of the still-warm blood, and the crushed bones do not puncture the tires, because the rubber, too, is bulletproof.<br><br>And so relentless is the wind that it rakes the street, pushing along this burden of crippled vermin, trundling this tide of suffering always in the wake of the Town Car as it reaches Spaulding Square. Fissures of lightning fracture the sky, and rain is pushed into great curtains that strafe the tiled roofs. Thunder blasts a fanfare as the rain plunders the city&#x2019;s garbage cans, loosing plastic bags and Styrofoam cups.<br><br>And hard by the looming tower of the Roosevelt Hotel the boulevard is otherwise deserted and the army of trash advances on the city unimpeded by traffic lights or other automobiles. Every street, every intersection is deserted. The sidewalks are empty, as the ancient soothsayers have promised, and every window is dark.<br><br>The boiling sky is without the roving lights of aircraft, and the choked storm drains leave the streets awash in rain and fur. These streets slippery with offal. And by Grauman&#x2019;s Chinese Theatre is all of Los Angeles reduced to such butchery and chaos.<br><br>Yet not far ahead of the car, in the 6700 block&#x2014;there the neon lights still shine. In that single block of Hollywood Boulevard the night is warm and still. No rain wets the pavement, and the green awnings of Musso and Frank Grill hang motionless. The clouds above that city block are open like a tunnel to reveal the moon, and the trees along the sidewalks are motionless. So coated in red are the headlights of the Lincoln that they cast a scarlet path for the car to follow. These glaring red beams reveal a young maiden on the sidewalk, and she stands across the street from the Hollywood Wax Museum. And there in the eye of this awful storm she gazes down on a star shape cast in pink concrete, sunk flush in the sidewalk. In her earlobes she wears dime-size, dazzle-cut cubic zirconia. And her feet are shod in counterfeit Manolo Blahniks. The soft folds of her straight-line skirt and cashmere sweater are dry. Masses of curled, red hair cascade about her shoulders.<br><br>The name cast in the pink star is &#x201c;Camille Spencer,&#x201d; but this maiden is not Camille Spencer.<br><br>A pink gob of dried chewing gum, several gobs, pink and gray and green, deface the sidewalk like scabs. Printed with the marks of human teeth, the gum is also printed with the zigzag tread of passing feet. The young maiden pries at these with the pointed toe of her faux-Manolo until she can kick the scabrous gum away. Until the star is, if not clean, cleaner.<br><br>In this bubble of still, placid night the maiden grips the hem of her skirt and brings it close to her mouth. She spits on the fabric and kneels to polish the star, buffing bright the name cast there in brass, embedded in the pink concrete. When the Town Car pulls to the curb beside her, the girl stands and steps around the star with the same respect with which one would step around a grave. In one hand she carries a pillowcase. Her fingers, their chipped white nails clenched in a fist, hold this sack of white cloth sagging heavy with Tootsie Rolls, Charleston Chews, and licorice whips. In her opposite hand she holds a half-eaten Baby Ruth.<br><br>Her porcelain-veneered teeth chew idly. A margin of melted chocolate outlines her pouting, bee-stung lips. The prophets of Sais warn that the beauty of this young woman is such that anyone seeing her will forget any pleasure beyond eating and sex. So physically appealing is her earthly form that her viewer is reduced to nothing more than stomach and skin. And the oracles sing that neither is she alive nor dead. Neither mortal nor spirit.<br><br>And parked, idling at the curb, the Lincoln is dripping red. The curbside rear window hums down a crack, and a voice announces itself from the plush interior. In the eye of that hurricane, a male voice asks, &#x201c;Trick or treat?&#x201d;<br><br>A stone&#x2019;s throw in any direction, the night remains churning behind an invisible wall.<br><br>The maiden&#x2019;s lips, glossed with a red-red lipstick&#x2014;a color called &#x201c;Man Hunt&#x201d;&#x2014;her full lips curl into a smile. Here, the air hangs so calm that one can detect the scent of her perfume, like flowers left in a tomb, pressed flat and dried for a thousand years. She leans close to the open window and says, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too late. It&#x2019;s already tomorrow. . . .&#x201d; She pauses for a long, lustful wink blanketed in turquoise eye shadow, and asks, &#x201c;What time is it?&#x201d;<br><br>And it&#x2019;s obvious the man is drinking champagne, because in that quiet moment even the bubbles of his champagne sound loud. And the ticking of the man&#x2019;s wristwatch sounds loud. And his voice within the car says, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time for all bad girls to go to bed.&#x201d;<br><br>Wistful now, the young woman sighs. She licks her lips, and her smile falters. Half-coy, half-resigned, she says, &#x201c;I guess I violated my curfew.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Being violated,&#x201d; says the man, &#x201c;can feel wonderful.&#x201d; In turn, the Lincoln&#x2019;s rear door swings open to admit her, and without hesitation the maiden steps inside. And that door constitutes a gate, the prophets sing. And that car is, itself, a mouth gobbling candy. And the Town Car shuts her within its stomach: an interior as thickly upholstered with velvet as a casket. The tinted window hums closed. The car idles, its hood steaming, its polished body streaming, edged now with a red fringe, a growing beard of coagulated blood. Crimson tire tracks lead up whence it came to where it now sits parked. Behind it, the storm lashes, but here the only sounds are the muffled ejaculations of a man crying out. The ancients describe the sound as a mewing, like rats and mice being crushed to death.<br><br>Silence follows, and after that the rear window once more slides open. The chipped white fingernails reach out. Dangling from them is a latex skin, a smaller version of the girl&#x2019;s white pillowcase, a miniature sack hanging heavy. Its contents: something murky white. This latex sheath is smeared with the red-red lipstick. It&#x2019;s smeared with caramel and milk chocolate. Instead of dropping this into the gutter, still seated in the car&#x2019;s backseat, the girl brings her face to the open window. She places the latex sack against her lips and breathes it full of air. She inflates it and deftly knots the open end. The way a midwife would secure the umbilical cord of an infant. The way a carnival clown would knot a balloon. She ties the inflated skin, sealing the milky contents within, and her fingers twist it. She bends and twists the tube of it until the shape becomes that of a human being with two arms, two legs, a head. A voodoo doll. It&#x2019;s the size of a newborn babe. This foul creation, still candy-coated from her lips, murky with the man&#x2019;s mysterious soupy contents, she flings into the center of the waiting pink star.<br><br>According to the prophecies writ down by Solon, that small effigy is a sacrifice of blood and seed and sugar, laid there on that sacred pentagram shape, an offering made beside Hollywood Boulevard.<br><br>On that night, with that ritual begins the countdown to Doomsday.<br><br>And once again the automobile&#x2019;s mirrored window fills its frame. And at this instant, the storm, the rain and darkness, these swallow the car. As the Lincoln departs the curb, bearing the young maiden away, the winds herd her castoff thing-baby. That knotted bladder. That graven image. The wind and rains shepherd their bountiful harvest of slaughtered vermin and plastic trash and dried chewing gum, tumbling and driving it all in the direction of gravity.<br><br>december 21, 6:03 a.m. cet<br>I Eat; Therefore I Am<br>Posted by Madisonspencer@aftrlife.hell<br><br> Gentle Tweeter,<br><br>It&#x2019;s worth noting up front that I have always conceived of my mind as a digestive organ.

Coetzee, the major motion picture stars John Malkovich.&nbsp;<b>J.M. Coetzee's latest novel,&nbsp;<i>The Schooldays of Jesus</i>, is now available from Viking.&nbsp;<i>Late Essays: 2006-2016</i>&nbsp;will be available January 2018.&nbsp;</b><br></b><br>At fifty-two, Professor David Lurie is divorced, filled with desire, but lacking in passion. When an affair with a student leaves him jobless, shunned by friends, and ridiculed by his ex-wife, he retreats to his daughter Lucy's smallholding. David's visit becomes an extended stay as he attempts to find meaning in his one remaining relationship. Instead, an incident of unimaginable terror and violence forces father and daughter to confront their strained relationship and the equallity complicated racial complexities of the new South Africa.</p><p>David Lurie is hardly the hero of his own life, or anyone else's. At 52, the protagonist of <i>Disgrace</i> is at the end of his professional and romantic game, and seems to be deliberately courting disaster. Long a professor of modern languages at Cape Town University College, he has recently been relegated to adjunct professor of communications at the same institution, now pointedly renamed Cape Technical University: <blockquote> Although he devotes hours of each day to his new discipline, he finds its first premise, as enunciated in the Communications 101 handbook, preposterous: "Human society has created language in order that we may communicate our thoughts, feelings and intentions to each other." His own opinion, which he does not air, is that the origins of speech lie in song, and the origins of song in the need to fill out with sound the overlarge and rather empty human soul. </blockquote> Twice married and twice divorced, his magnetic looks on the wane, David rather cruelly seduces one of his students, and his conduct unbecoming is soon uncovered. In his eighth novel, J.M. Coetzee might have been content to write a searching academic satire. But in <i>Disgrace</i> he is intent on much more, and his art is as uncompromising as his main character, though infinitely more complex. Refusing to play the public-repentance game, David gets himself fired--a final gesture of contempt. Now, he thinks, he will write something on Byron's last years. Not empty, unread criticism, "prose measured by the yard," but a libretto. To do so, he heads for the Eastern Cape and his daughter's farm. In her mid-20s, Lucy has turned her back on city sophistications: with five hectares, she makes her living by growing flowers and produce and boarding dogs. "Nothing," David thinks, "could be more simple." But nothing, in fact, is more complicated--or, in the new South Africa, more dangerous. Far from being the refuge he has sought, little is safe in Salem. Just as David has settled into his temporary role as farmworker and unenthusiastic animal-shelter volunteer, he and Lucy are attacked by three black men. Unable to protect his daughter, David's disgrace is complete. Hers, however, is far worse. <p> There is much more to be explored in Coetzee's painful novel, and few consolations. It would be easy to pick up on his title and view <i>Disgrace</i> as a complicated working-out of personal and political shame and responsibility. But the author is concerned with his country's history, brutalities, and betrayals. Coetzee is also intent on what measure of soul and rights we allow animals. After the attack, David takes his role at the shelter more seriously, at last achieving an unlikely home and some measure of love. In Coetzee's recent Princeton lectures, <i>The Lives of Animals</i>, an aging novelist tells her audience that the question that occupies all lab and zoo creatures is, "Where is home, and how do I get there?" David, though still all-powerful compared to those he helps dispose of, is equally trapped, equally lost. </p><p> <i>Disgrace</i> is almost willfully plain. Yet it possesses its own lean, heartbreaking lyricism, most of all in its descriptions of unwanted animals. At the start of the novel, David tells his student that poetry either speaks instantly to the reader--"a flash of revelation and a flash of response"--or not at all. Coetzee's book speaks differently, its layers and sadnesses endlessly unfolding. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>"The richness of <b>Disgrace</b> lies in the elegant and allegorical role reversals, the spare symbolism of the language and in the characterization. We may not like David Lurie, but in Coetzee's skillful hands we can't dismiss him without pity." -- <i>The Globe and Mail</i> <br> <br>"Coetzee is able to dissect the human psyche with a surgeon's touch." -- <i>The Hamilton Spectator</i> <br> <br>"Marvellous." -- <i>The National Post</i> <br> <br>" <b>Disgrace</b> is a subtle, multilayered story, as much concerned with politics as it is with the itch of male flesh. Coetzee's prose is chaste and lyrical -- it is a relief to encounter writing as quietly stylish as this." -- <i>Independent</i> <br> <br>" <b>Disgrace</b> is at the frontier of world literature." -- <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> <br> <br>"J.M. Coetzee's vision goes to the nerve-centre of being. What he finds there is more than most people will ever know about themselves, and he conveys it with a brilliant writer's mastery of tension and elegance." -- Nadine Gordimer</p><h2>Works Of Jules Verne: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, A Journey to the Center of the Earth, Around the World in 80 Days, From the Earth to the Moon, Round the Moon, and selected short stories</h2><p>The fiction of Jules Verne includes social satire and works of science fiction that demonstrate his prophetic view of the future</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Prospero&#39;s Cell</h2><p>Prospero&#39;s Cell A Guide to the Landscape and Manners of the Island of Corcyra</p><p></p><h2>Fret Work Step By Step (Stewart-Macdonald Shopguide Series)</h2><p>This book answers the hundreds of questions the author received about fretting.

MCKILLIP</b></p><p></p><p>Table of Contents</p><p>Prologue</p><p>The White Wolf followed the ravens down the crags of Chaumenard to the wintry fields of Pelucir.</p><p>In wolf shape, among the wolves, he had scented danger sweeping toward the mountains he loved. His dreams turned dark with the coming of winter, chaotic, disturbed by fire, blood, the sharp, hoarse cries of ravens calling to one another, the cries of humans. Darkness rode a dark horse into the heart of Pelucir, wielding a sword of fire and bone that pierced the Wolf&#x2019;s dreams. He would wake suddenly in human shape, in a close tangle of fur and smells, trying to see beyond stone, beyond night, into the fire that burned toward Chaumenard. Finally, harrowed by dreams and unable to rest content in wolf shape, he ran to meet the dark rider in Pelucir. He would stop it there, somehow, in the broad fields and gentle hills of the kingdom bordering Chaumenard, before the rider cast its blank, hungry eye into the land of mages and scholars and farmers who raised goats in the high peaks, and plowed a furrow from light into shadow down their sharply sloping sides.</p><p>The mage was old, and lingered, every year, longer and longer in the mountains among the wolves. That year, he had forgotten it was winter and that he was human. Pulled so abruptly back into the world, he had not stopped to tell anyone where he was going. Nor did he know who fought in Pelucir. He ran, in wolf shape, faster than any wolf; he was a shimmer of icy wind blowing down the mountain&#x2019;s flank, the white shadow of his own legend, barely perceptible, moving swiftly, silently, under the staring winter moon, toward the eye of the terrible storm: the castle of the Kings of Pelucir.</p><p>He had seen Pelucir in fairer days, when the massive, bulky castle stood surrounded by flowering fields, the slow river running under its bridge reflecting such green that drinking it would be drinking summer itself. The ancient keep, a dark, square tower beginning to drop a stone here and there, like old teeth, faced lush fields and meadows that rolled to a rounded hill where an endless wood of oak and birch began. Now the trees stood stark and silvery with moonlight, and on the fields a hundred fires burned in the burning cold, ringed around the castle.</p><p>The mage, still little more than a glitter of windblown snow, paused under the moon shadow of a parapet wall. Tents billowed and sagged in the wind; sentries shivered at the fires, watching the castle, listening. Wings rustled in deep shadow; a sentry threw a stone suddenly, breathing a curse, and a ragged tumble of black leaves swirled up in the wind, then dropped again. Another sentry spoke sharply to him; they were both silent, watching, listening.</p><p>The mage drifted past them, searching; dreams and random nightmares blew against him and clung. Within the castle, children wrapped in ancient tapestries wept in their sleep; someone screamed incessantly and would not be comforted; young sentries whispered of fowl browning on a spit, of hot game pie; old men trembling in the ramparts longed for the fires below, the sturdy oak on the hill. On the field, men feverish with wounds dreamed of feet made of ice instead of flesh and bone, of the sharp end of bone where a hand should be, of a mass of black feathers shifting, softly rustling in the shadows, waiting. The mage saw finally what he searched for: a flame held in a mailed fist on a purple field, the banner of the ruling house of Kardeth.</p><p>He had known rulers of Kardeth in his long life: fierce and brilliant warrior-princes who grew restless easily and found the choice between acquiring knowledge and acquiring someone else&#x2019;s land an arbitrary one. Scholars, they spoke with equal passion of the ancient books and arts of Chaumenard, and of its rich valleys and wild, harsh peaks. This ruler, whose name escaped the mage, must have regarded Pelucir as a minor obstruction between Kardeth and Chaumenard. But while his army ringed the castle, laying a bitter winter siege, winter had laid siege to him. He had the wood on the hill for game and firewood; he had only to sit and wait, starving the castle into surrender. But there was nothing yielding about the massive gates, the great keep with its single upper window red with fire, the torchlit battlements spilling light and the shadows of armed warriors onto the snow. In the wood, the game would be growing scarce, and what remained of it, thin and desperate in the harsh season.</p><p>So the chilled, hungry, exhausted dreamers around the mage told him in their dreams. He took his own shape slowly in front of the prince&#x2019;s tent: a tall man with hair as white as fish bone and a face weathered and hard as the crags he loved. He wore next to nothing and carried nothing. Still the guards clamored around him awhile, shouting of sorcery and warding invisible things away with their arrows. The prince pushed apart the hangings and walked barefoot into the snow, a sword in one hand.</p><p>The mage, noting how the prince resembled his red-haired grandfather, finally remembered his name. The prince blinked, his grim, weary face loosening slightly in wonder. Around him the guard quieted.</p><p>&#x201c;Let him go,&#x201d; Riven of Kardeth said. &#x201c;He is a mage of Chaumenard.&#x201d; He opened the tent hangings. &#x201c;Come in.&#x201d; He nodded at a pallet where a man, white and dizzy with fever, struggled with his boots. &#x201c;My uncle Marnye. He was wounded last night.&#x201d; He took the boots out of his uncle&#x2019;s hands and pushed him gently down. His mouth tightened again. &#x201c;They come out at night&#x2014;the warriors of Pelucir. I don&#x2019;t know how. They have a secret passageway. Gates open noiselessly for them. Or they slip under walls, through stone. At dawn I find sentries frozen in the snow, dark birds picking at them. My uncle heard something and was struck down as he raised an alarm. We could find no one. That&#x2019;s why my sentries are so wary of sorcery.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There is no magic in that house,&#x201d; the mage said. &#x201c;Only hunger. And rage.&#x201d;</p><p>He knelt by the pallet, slid his hand beneath Marnye&#x2019;s head and looked into his blurred, glittering eyes. For an instant, his own head throbbed, his lips dried, his body ached with fever. &#x201c;Sleep,&#x201d; he breathed, and drew the word into a gentle, formless darkness easing through the restless, shivering body. Marnye&#x2019;s eyes closed. &#x201c;Sleep,&#x201d; he murmured, and the mage&#x2019;s eyes grew heavy, closed. Sleep bound them like a spell. Then the mage opened his eyes and rose, stepping away from the pallet. He said, his voice changing, no louder, but taut and intense with passion, &#x201c;This must stop.&#x201d;</p><p>The prince, feeling the whip of power behind the words, watched the mage silently a moment. He said finally, carefully, &#x201c;Thank you for helping my uncle. The ancient mages of Chaumenard do not involve themselves with war.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You are threatening Chaumenard itself. I know Kardeth. You will crack Pelucir like a nut, take what you want. But you will not stop here. You will not stop until you have laid claim to every mountain pass and goatherder&#x2019;s hut in Chaumenard.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And every rich valley and every ancient book.&#x201d; Still Riven watched the mage; he spoke courteously, but inflexibly. &#x201c;Chaumenard is ungoverned. It is full of isolated farmers and wealthy schools where rulers send their children, and villagers who carry their villages around on their backs in the high plateaus.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They will fight you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That will be as they choose.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you survive this place.&#x201d;</p><p>The prince&#x2019;s eyes flickered. He drew breath noiselessly and moved, letting the weariness show in his face, in his sagging shoulders. He unfolded a leather stool for the mage, and sat down himself. He said, surprising the mage, &#x201c;Atrix Wolfe.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. How&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I saw you, when my grandfather ruled Kardeth. I was very young. But I never forgot you. The White Wolf of Chaumenard, my grandfather called you, and told us tales of your power when you had gone. He said you were&#x2014;are&#x2014;the greatest living mage.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am nearly the oldest,&#x201d; Atrix murmured, feeling it as he sat.</p><p>&#x201c;I questioned him, for such power seemed invaluable to Kardeth.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As a weapon.&#x201d;</p><p>The prince shrugged slightly. &#x201c;I am what I am. He said that such power among the greatest mages has its clearly formulated restrictions.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Experience teaches us restrictions,&#x201d; the mage reminded him. &#x201c;They are not dreamed up in some peaceful tower on a mountaintop. If we involved ourselves with war, we would end up fighting each other, and create far more disaster than even you could imagine. Power is not peaceful. But we try to be.

Wells's award-winning book No Place for Truth - called "a stinging indictment of evangelicalism's theological corruption" by TIME magazine - woke many evangelicals to the fact that their tradition has slowly but surely capitulated to the values and structures of modernity. In God in the Wasteland Wells continues his trenchant analysis of the cultural corruption now weakening the church's thought and witness with the intent of getting evangelicals to rethink their relationship to the "world."<br>Wells argues that the church is enfeebled in part because it has lost its sense of God's sovereignty and holiness. "The fundamental problem in the evangelical world today," says Wells, "is that God rests too inconsequentially upon the church. His truth is too distant, his grace is too ordinary, his judgment is too benign, his gospel is too easy, and his Christ is too common." God has become weightless to the extent that the church no longer allows him to shape its character, outlook, and practice.<br>Evangelicals have become heavily invested in the mind-set of modernity - a mind-set that Wells correlates with the biblical concept of the "world." They have become enamored of advanced management and marketing techniques, have blurred the distinctions between Christ and culture, and have largely abandoned their traditional emphasis on divine transcendence in favor of an emphasis on divine immanence. In doing so, they have produced a faith in God that is of little consequence to those who believe. An extensive survey of students at seven evangelical theological seminaries - the results of which are included in this book - indicates that the next generation of evangelical leaders is as caught up in these trends as the laity.<br>Arguing that the church's diminished appetite for truth will not be restored without repentance and a fresh encounter with the holy God, Wells makes a compelling case for urgently needed reform in the evangelical church. Without such reform, he says, evangelical faith will be lost in and to the modernity that has invaded the church.</p><p>David F. Wells is the Andrew Mutch Distinguished Professor of Historical and Systematic Theology at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, South Hamilton, Massachusetts.Continuing the examination of evangelical theology he started in No Place for Truth; or, Whatever Happened to Evangelical Theology (Eerdmans, 1993), Wells expands on the previous work by offering a remedy to the diminished place of theology in the church by suggesting a return to a belief in God and away from culture modernization or worldliness. Wells is convincing in his statements that mass consumerism and self-obsession lead to mega-churches where the "consumer is sovereign, the product (in this God himself) must be subservient." A comparative survey of seminarians conducted during 1988 and 1993 provides support for this religion of civility. An extensive bibliography makes this book a useful addition for more substantial religion collections.<br><i>L.

She hadn't been dreaming of a white Christmas but it seemed she was getting one anyway.<br><br>Far below, the streets of Manhattan were jammed with tourists keen to enjoy the festive sights of New York in the holiday season. A giant spruce twinkled in front of the Rockefeller Centre, and the Hudson River glinted in the distance, a ribbon of silvery-gray shimmering in the winter light.<br><br>Turning her back on the snow, the tree and the glittering skyscrapers of Midtown, Kayla focused on her computer screen.<br><br>A moment later the door opened and Tony, her opposite number in Entertainment and Sports, appeared carrying two glasses of champagne.<br><br>She unhooked her headphones. "Who the hell is picking the music out there?"<br><br>"You don't like the music?" The top button of his shirt was undone and the glitter in his eyes suggested this wasn't his first glass of champagne. "Is that why you're hiding in your office?"<br><br>"I'm searching for inner peace but I'd settle for outer peace so if you could close the door on your way out, that would be perfect."<br><br>"Come on, Kayla. We're celebrating our best year ever. It's a British tradition to get drunk, sing terrible karaoke and flirt with your colleagues."<br><br>"Who told you that?"<br><br>"I watched <em>Bridget Jones's Diary.''''</em><br><br>"Right." The music made her head throb. It was always the same at this time of year. The tight panicky feeling in her stomach. The ache in her chest that didn't ease until December 26th. "Tony, did you want something? Because I'd like to keep working."<br><br>"It's our office party. You cannot work late tonight."<br><br>As far as she was concerned it was the perfect night to work late.<br><br>"Have you seen <em>A Christmas Carol?</em> Or read the book?"<br><br>A glass of champagne appeared on the desk in front of her. "I'm guessing you're not Tiny Tim in this scenario, so that makes you either Scrooge or one of the ghosts."<br><br>"I'm Scrooge, but without the tasteless nightwear." Ignoring the champagne, Kayla glanced through the doorway. "Is Melinda out there?"<br><br>"Last seen charming the CEO of Adventure Travel who has been looking for you all evening so he can thank you personally for the incredible year their company has enjoyed. Bookings are up two hundred percent since you took over their account. Not only that, you got his picture on the cover of <em>Time</em> magazine." He raised his glass and his mouth twisted into a smile. "Until you arrived in New York, I was the golden boy. Brett used to give me tips on how to be the one on top. I was all set to be the youngest vice president this firm has ever appointed."<br><br>Alarm bells rang in her head. "Tony&#x2014;"<br><br>"Now it's likely that accolade will go to you."<br><br>"You're still the golden boy. We work in separate divisions. Could we talk about this tomorrow?" Kayla delved into her bag for a report, wishing she could push herself inside and snap it shut until January. "I'm really busy."<br><br>"Too busy to nurse my ego a little bit?"<br><br>She eyed the champagne. "I've always believed people should be responsible for their own egos."<br><br>He gave a low laugh. "Coming from anyone else I'd assume there was innuendo in there, but you don't do innuendo, do you? You don't have time for it. Just like you don't have time for parties or dinner or drinks on the way home after work. You don't have time for anything <em>except</em> work. For Kayla Green, associate vice president of Tourism and Hospitality, it's all about the next piece of business. Do you realize there's a bet going in the office as to whether you sleep with your phone?"<br><br>"Of course I sleep with my phone. Don't you?"<br><br>"No. Sometimes I sleep with a human, Kayla. A hot, naked woman. Sometimes I forget about work and indulge in a night of really incredible sex." His eyes were on hers, his message unmistakable and Kayla wished she'd locked her office door.<br><br>"Tony&#x2014;"<br><br>"I'm probably about to make a giant fool of myself, but&#x2014;"<br><br><em>"Please</em> don't." Deciding she might need both hands, Kayla gave up looking for the file. "Go back to the party."<br><br>"You are the sexiest woman I've ever met." <em>Oh, shit.</em><br><br>"Tony&#x2014;"<br><br>"When you transferred here from London straight into the AVP role, I admit I was ready to hate you, but you charmed us all with your cute British ways and you charmed Brett with your killer business instinct." He leaned forward. "And you charmed <em>me."</em><br><br>Kayla eyed the glass in his hand. "How many of those have you had?"<br><br>"The other day I was watching you in the boardroom presenting to your client. You never stand still."<br><br>"I think better when I walk around."<br><br>"Yeah, you walk around in that tight little pencil skirt that shows off your ass and those skyscraper heels that show off miles of leg, and all the time you were walking I was thinking, 'Kayla Green has the sharpest mind in the business, but she also has a <em>great</em> pair of legs&#x2014;'"<br><br>"Tony&#x2014;"<br><br>"'&#x2014;and not only does she have a great pair of legs, she also amazing green eyes that can kill a man from a thousand paces.'"<br><br>She stared hard at him and then shook her head. "Nope. Not working. You're still alive, so that's something else you're wrong about. Now go back to the party."<br><br>"Let's get out of here, Green. My place. Just you, me and my super big bed."<br><br>"Tony&#x2014;" She tried to inject just the right tone into her voice. Firm, professional and absolutely not interested. "I understand how much courage it took for you to be honest about your feelings, and I'm going to be equally candid." <em>Well, not quite, but as close to candid as she ever came.</em> "Quite apart from the fact I would never get personal with a colleague because it would be unprofessional, I'm totally rubbish at relationships."<br><br>"You couldn't be rubbish at anything. I heard Brett telling a client this week that you're a superstar." An edge of bitterness crept into his voice and she sighed.<br><br>"Is that what this is about? Competition? Because honestly, when Brett was giving you tips on how to be on top, I don't think he meant you to take it quite so literally."<br><br>"Hot, dirty sex, Kayla, and just for tonight." He raised his glass. "Tomorrow doesn't exist."<br><br>As far as she was concerned tomorrow couldn't come soon enough. "Good night, Tony."<br><br>"I would make you forget your emails."<br><br>"No man has ever made me forget my emails." Contemplating that depressing fact did nothing to improve her mood. "You are drunk and you are going to regret this in the morning."<br><br>He sat down on her desk, flattening a stack of invoices awaiting her signature. "I thought I worked hard and then I met you. Kayla Green, public relations genius who never puts a foot wrong."<br><br>She tugged at the invoices. "My foot will be in your butt if you don't get off my invoices."<br><br>"Butt? I thought you British called it an arse."<br><br>"Butt, arse&#x2014;call it whatever you like, just get it off my desk. Now go home before you say something you shouldn't to someone important." About to stand up and eject him physically, she was relieved when her office door opened and Stacy, her PA, walked in.<br><br>Her gaze fixed on the empty glass in Tony's hand. "Ah, Tony&#x2014;Brett is looking for you. New business opportunity. He says you're the man to handle it."<br><br>"Really? In that case&#x2014;" Tony scooped up Kayla's untouched glass and strolled toward the door "&#x2014;nothing stands in the way of business, does it? Certainly not pleasure."<br><br>Stacy watched him go, eyebrows raised. "What's got into him?"<br><br>"Two bottles of champagne got into him." Kayla dropped her head into her hands and stared blankly at the screen. "Was Brett really looking for him?"<br><br>"No, but you looked as if you were about to punch him, and I didn't want you to spend Christmas in custody. I've heard the food is terrible."<br><br>"You are one in a million and you're in line for a fat bonus."<br><br>"You already gave me a fat bonus. I treated myself to this top." Stacy twirled like a ballerina and black sequins gleamed under the lights. "What do you think?"<br><br>"Love it. Just don't stand too near Tentacle Tony."<br><br>"I think he's cute." Stacy blushed. "Sorry. Too much information."<br><br>"You think he's hot?" Kayla stared at the door where Tony had exited a few moments earlier and wondered what was wrong with her. "Seriously?"<br><br>"Everyone does. Everyone except you, obviously, but that's because you work too hard to notice. Why don't you come and join the party?"<br><br>"Everyone will be chatting about the holidays. I'm fine talking about work but I'm useless with kids, pets and grandmas."<br><br>"Talking of work, we have a potential new business lead. The guy is coming in tomorrow to brief us. Brett wants you in on that meeting."<br><br>Relieved the topic had shifted, Kayla perked up.<br><br>"What guy?"<br><br>"Jackson O'Neil."<br><br>"Jackson O'Neil." She filed through her brain. "CEO of Snowdrift Leisure. They own a handful of luxury hotels specializing in winter sports. Mostly European based. Zermatt, Klosters, Chamonix. Impressive track record. Very successful. What about him?"<br><br>Stacy gaped at her. "How do you <em>know</em> all this stuff?"<br><br>"It's what I do when other people have a social life." Kayla typed <em>Jackson O 'Neil</em> into the search engine. "Do they want us to work with them? I can talk to someone in the London office."<br><br>"It isn't the European business. And it isn't Snowdrift Leisure. He took a backseat in the company eighteen months ago so he could move back to the U.S. and focus on the family business."<br><br>"Really? How did I miss that?" Kayla looked at the photographs that came up on her screen. Jackson O'Neil was at least two decades younger than she'd imagined him to be. Instead of the usual corporate head and shoulders shot, there was a photograph of him skiing down what looked like a vertical slope. Her head spun as she looked at the gradient. "Is that Photoshop?"<br><br>Stacy peered over her shoulder and made an appreciative sound. "That man is seriously hot. I bet he drinks vodka martinis, shaken not stirred. It's not Photoshop. All three O'Neil brothers are skiers. Tyler O'Neil was on the U.S. ski team until he injured himself. They're always flinging themselves off some cliff or other."<br><br>"So I'd probably better not mention I feel dizzy at the top of the Empire State Building." Kayla clicked off the picture. "Snowdrift Leisure is a fast-growing, successful company. Why isn't he focusing on that?"<br><br>"Family. The O'Neil family owns the Snow Crystal Resort and Spa in Vermont."<br><br><em>Family.</em> The most destructive force known to man. "Never heard of it."<br><br>"I guess that's why he's contacted us for help."<br><br>"If he'd wanted to run the family business, why didn't he do that straight off instead of setting up his own company?" She clicked through the Snow Crystal website, looking at images. A large Alpine-style hotel and log cabins nestling in a forest. A couple, smiling adoringly in the back of a horse-drawn sleigh. Laughing families skating on a frozen pond. She quickly returned to the images of the cabins. "Maybe he's a guy who prefers a challenge."<br><br>"No doubt he'll tell you why when you meet. He asked for you. He saw what you did for Adventure Travel."<br><br>Kayla stared at the log cabins, and thought how peaceful they looked. "Are they putting the business out to pitch?"<br><br>"Brett thinks if you can impress Jackson O'Neil tomorrow, the business is ours."<br><br>"Then we'd better make sure we impress him."<br><br>"I'm sure you will." Stacy hesitated. "Have you ever skied?"<br><br>"Not exactly. I mean, I've never actually worn a pair of skis <em>as such,</em> but I skidded on the snow outside Bloomingdales last week. I felt as if my gut was going to come up through my mouth. Skiing must give you a similar feeling."<br><br>Stacy laughed. "My parents took me to Vermont when I was little. All I remember was ice. Even the trees were frozen."<br><br>"That's perfect because I love ice."<br><br>"You do?"<br><br>"Absolutely. Ideally I prefer it crushed in a margarita or carved into a swan as a centerpiece on a buffet table, but I can go with it under my feet if I have to. I'll be fine, Stacy. I'm helping them promote the company, not going on holiday there. When I worked on that African Safari account, did I have to hug a lion? No, I did not." Kayla felt the familiar buzz that always came when facing a new business opportunity. Her fears of the dreaded Christmas period were soothed by the knowledge she now had a legitimate reason to bury herself in work. She'd get through it, as she always did, and no one would be any the wiser. "Be an angel and dig up as much information as you can on Snow Crystal and the O'Neil family, particularly Jackson. I want to know why he took a backseat in his highly successful business to return home and run a place I can't even find on a map."<br><br>"I'll have it for you first thing tomorrow." Brisk and efficient, Stacy made a note in her book. "Maybe you should take a break, Kayla. You're forgetting it's Christmas!"<br><br>"I'm not forgetting."<br><br>She'd been trying to forget for a decade and a half. <em>There was no forgetting.</em><br><br>Whenever she left her apartment or her office she walked with her head down, avoiding glimpses of glittering window displays and twinkly lights, but nothing helped.<br><br>Stacy tidied the stack of invoices. "Are you sure you won't change your mind and join our team trip to see Santa?"<br><br>It felt as if someone were sawing through her stomach.<br><br>Dragging open her drawer, Kayla pulled out indigestion tablets and swallowed two. She wondered whether taking the lot would put her out until after Christmas. "Can't, sorry, but I appreciate the invitation."<br><br>"There will be Christmas trees, elves&#x2014;"<br><br>"Oh, God, poor you."<br><br>"Why poor me? I love Christmas." Stacy shot her a puzzled look. "Don't you?"<br><br>"I adore Christmas. I'm totally gutted I can't make it. I meant poor me, not poor you." The effort of smiling was making her jaw ache. "Think of me while you're mingling with elves."<br><br>"Maybe you should come anyway and talk to Santa. You can give him your Christmas list. Dear Santa, please give me the Snow Crystal account together with a massive budget, and, while you're at it, I'll have Jackson O'Neil naked. Hold the gift wrap."<br><br>The only thing she wanted for Christmas was for it to be over as fast as possible.<br><br>Memories hit her with a thump, and Kayla stood up abruptly and paced to the window. All around her were reminders of Christmas, so she paced back to her desk and sat down again, vowing to book a cruise to Antarctica next year. Whale watching. Whales didn't celebrate Christmas, did they?<br><br>The phone on her desk rang and she breathed a sigh of relief. <em>Thank goodness.</em><br><br>Stacy snapped into professional mode and reached across the desk, but Kayla stopped her.<br><br>"I'll get it. I'm expecting a call from the CEO of Extreme Explore.

Long passionate about the Civil War buff, she has studied theera avidly and has&nbsp;made many visits to Gettysburg,&nbsp; where she has witnessedreenactments of the legendary clash between North and South. Linda exploresthat turbulent time in <i>The Yankee Widow.</i>Molly Shields forced herself to pause on the sidewalk in front of the huge brick house, draw a deep breath and let it out slowly. If she hadn't, she would have vaulted over the gate and covered the flagstone walk at a dead run.<p> </p><p><i>Lucas.</i></p><p> </p><p>Lucas was somewhere inside that enormous place. But so was Psyche. And Psyche Ryan, at least in the eyes of the world, was legally Lucas's mother.</p><p> </p><p>Everything within Molly rebelled against that single fact.</p><p> </p><p>Purposefully Molly adjusted her perspective, along with the canvas backpack she'd carried from the gas station at the far end of Indian Rock, Arizona, after getting off the afternoon bus from Phoenix. Lucas wasn't her child; he was Psyche's.</p><p> </p><p>The little boy was eighteen months old now eighteen months, two weeks and five days. he'd been a newborn, pink and squalling, when she'd last seen him, held him in her arms all too briefly before giving him up. Psyche had sent a few snapshots in the interim Lucas was solid, handsome and blond, with bright green eyes. Molly's own coloring, though her hair had darkened over time, but despite that, he resembled his late father more than her.</p><p> </p><p>Now, in a very few minutes, maybe even moments, Molly would see the baby she still thought of as her own, at least in weak moments.</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps she'd be allowed to hold Lucas. She ached to do that. To breathe in the scent of his hair and skin."</p><p> </p><p><i>Careful,</i> her practical side admonished.</p><p> </p><p>It was miracle enough that Psyche, a virtual stranger and, it was to be remembered, a betrayed wife, had summoned Molly to this little town, with its shady streets, given all that had happened. She mustn't move too fast, or make a wrong move miracles were rare and fragile things, to be handled with infinite care.</p><p> </p><p>Molly worked the latch on the shiny black iron gate. The metal felt hot and smooth to the touch. A discreet little sign, fastened to the ornate fence, proclaimed the place a registered historic site.</p><p> </p><p>Psyche had explained, in one of her e-mails, that the house on the corner of Maple and Red River Drive, her childhood home, had stood empty for nearly a decade. But today the vast lawn looked manicured, lilacs and roses bloomed in freshly mulched beds and the many mullioned windows shone. The white wooden trim looked freshly painted, and the brick, though time worn, was still damp in places from a recent power wash.</p><p> </p><p>Molly forced herself to walk slowly up the walk, toward the front porch, part of which was screened in. No doubt there were patio chairs there, a little table and maybe even a wooden swing.</p><p> </p><p>Molly pictured herself sitting in that swing, rocking Lucas to sleep on a warm summer evening, and her heart beat a little faster.</p><p> </p><p><i>Psyche's child,</i> she repeated to herself in a silent mantra. <i>Psyche's child.</i></p><p> </p><p>She had no idea why Psyche had summoned her, or how long she'd be staying. The woman had graciously offered first-class airfare from LAX, with a car and driver to meet her in Phoenix. But Molly, perhaps as a form of penance, had chosen to take the bus instead.</p><p> </p><p>She'd have been wiser not to come at all, of course, but she hadn't been able to resist the chance to see Lucas.</p><p> </p><p>The heavy front door swung open just as Molly reached the bottom step, jolting her out of her travel-weary speculations, and a middle-aged black woman appeared, thin and tall, clad in a crisp white uniform and sensible, crepe-soled shoes.</p><p> </p><p>"You her?, she asked bluntly.</p><p> </p><p>Molly was "her," all right. Lucas's birth mother, the woman who had slept with Psyche's husband. It didn't matter that Molly truly hadn't known he was married until it was too late. That was always the excuse, wasn't it? She was intelligent, with a college education, her own business. Thayer had been a facile liar, but she should have seen the signs.</p><p> </p><p>There were always signs.</p><p> </p><p>Molly swallowed. Nodded in glum acknowledgment. "Well, get yourself on in here," the woman said, fanning herself with one hand. "I can't stand on this porch all day with the door hanging open, you know. Air-conditioning costs money." </p><p> </p><p>Molly hid a rueful smile. Psyche had mentioned her housekeeper several times over the past several weeks said she was cantankerous, but kind, too. "You must be Florence," Molly said mildly, swallowing an urge to explain that she <i>wasn't</i> a home wrecker.</p><p> </p><p>Florence frowned, spared an unfriendly nod. "Is that backpack all the luggage you brought?"</p><p> </p><p>Molly shook her head. "I have some more stuff at the gas station," she replied. "It was too heavy to carry." Some of her private regrets were like that, too, but she slogged on, mostly because she didn't know what else to do.</p><p> </p><p>Florence, practically bristling with disapproval, gave a sniff and adjusted her glasses. It was no great wonder that she hadn't put out a welcome mat, figurative or otherwise, given the things Psyche must have told her. Most of which, unfortunately, were probably true.</p><p> </p><p>After issuing a <i>harrumph,</i> Florence stepped aside to let Molly pass. "We'll take the station wagon down there later, and fetch it all," Florence said. "Right now, Miss Psyche's upstairs resting, but I've got to keep an eye on her just the same." Behind her thick glasses Florence's chocolate-brown eyes glazed over for a moment, and she gave a sad huff of a sigh. "My poor baby," she added, addressing the shrubbery more than Molly. "It practically wore her out, getting this house opened and moving us in. If it was up to me, we'd have stayed right in Flagstaff, where we belonged, but there's no reasoning with that girl once she takes a notion." </p><p> </p><p>Molly longed to ask about Lucas, but she had to tread carefully, especially around this longtime family retainer. Florence Washington had been Psyche's nanny until Psyche was old enough to go to school, then the family maid. When Psyche married Thayer Ryan, Mrs. Washington had stayed on to run the new household.</p><p> </p><p>Molly felt a sick little flutter way down in the pit of her stomach. </p><p> </p><p>Thayer was dead he'd suffered a massive coronary a year before, at the age of thirty-seven and while Molly wouldn't have wished him into an early grave, even after he'd all but ruined her life, she certainly hadn't mourned him, either.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn't gone to the funeral.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn't sent flowers, or even a card.</p><p> </p><p>After all, how would she have signed it? "With sympathy, your late husband's mistress�&#x20ac; ? </p><p> </p><p>Florence trudged off through an entryway with a grandfather clock and a curving staircase, and then down a long corridor, massive, drape-darkened rooms lining the passage on either side. Molly followed circumspectly, and they finally emerged into a sunlit kitchen with floor-to-ceiling windows forming the back wall and overlooking another enclosed porch. A flower-bright, sprawling yard lay beyond.</p><p> </p><p>Molly finally shrugged out of her backpack and set it down on one of the chairs at the huge antique table in the center of the room.</p><p> </p><p>"You might as well sit," Florence said.</p><p> </p><p><i>Might as well,</i> Molly thought. She was tired she'd ridden more than one bus since leaving L.A. two days before but her first inclination was still to ransack that mansion room by room, flinging open doors until she found Lucas.</p><p> </p><p>She drew back one of the heavy oak chairs and sagged into it.</p><p> </p><p>"Coffee?, Florence asked. "Tea?"</p><p> </p><p>"Water would be good," Molly said.</p><p> </p><p>"Fizzy stuff or regular?"</p><p> </p><p>"Regular, please." Florence brought her a glass of ice and a bottle. While Molly poured, Florence took up an obstinate pose over by the sink, leaning against the counter with her arms folded.</p><p> </p><p>"What are you doing here?, Florence demanded, evidently having withheld the question as long as she could.</p><p> </p><p>Molly, about to take a sip of water, set her glass down again. "I don't know," she answered truthfully. Psyche had contacted her by phone a week before and issued an urgent summons, with very little accompanying explanation.</p><p> </p><p>"We have to talk about this in person," she'd said.</p><p> </p><p>"Seems to me you've done enough damage," Florence told her, " without coming here. Especially now." </p><p> </p><p>Molly swallowed. She was thirty years old, and she ran one of the biggest literary agencies in L.A., dealt with egotistical, high-powered authors, editors and movie people practically every day. Now, sitting in Psyche Ryan's kitchen, clad in the jeans, T-shirt and sneakers she'd been wearing for forty-eight hours straight, she felt diminished, as though she'd regressed to her college days, when she hadn't had the proverbial two nickels to rub together.</p><p> </p><p>"Don't give her a hard time, Florence," a gentle voice interceded softly from somewhere behind Molly's chair. "I<i> asked</i> her to come, and Molly was kind enough to agree." </p><p> </p><p>Both Molly and Florence turned, Molly rising so quickly that she nearly knocked over her chair.</p><p> </p><p>Psyche stood framed in a doorway, a painfully thin woman clad in a peach silk robe and matching slippers. Two aspects of her appearance leaped out at Molly one, Psyche was beautiful and, two, she was obviously bald beneath the little crocheted cap she wore.</p><p> </p><p>"Will you look in on Lucas, please?, Psyche said to Florence. "He was still asleep a few minutes ago, but he's not used to the house yet, and I'd rather he didn't wake up alone." </p><p> </p><p>Florence hesitated, gave a terse nod, glowered once at Molly and left the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>"Sit down," Psyche told Molly, gliding gracefully toward her. </p><p> </p><p>Molly, who was used to giving orders, not taking them, immediately complied.</p><p> </p><p>Psyche drew back the chair next to Molly's and sat down with a little sigh and a gingerly wince. "Thank you for coming," she said, offering a hand. "I'm Psyche Ryan." </p><p> </p><p>Molly shook the hand, found it weightless as a wad of tracing paper. "Molly Shields," she replied. Her gaze drifted to Psyche's cap, back to the pair of enormous violet eyes beneath it.</p><p> </p><p>Psyche smiled slightly. "Yes," she said. "I have cancer."...</p></p><h2>The Value of Determination: The Story of Helen Keller (Valuetales)</h2><p>Focuses on Helen Keller&#39;s determination to hear, see, and speak and her equal determination to help others with handicaps similar to her own.</p><p></p><h2>How Your Mind Can Heal Your Body</h2><p><p>The connection between your mind and body is close, powerful, and often a valuable tool in taking control of your life and ambitions.

The rough trails are his home, from the Big Thicket to the Pecos to the border. He&#39;s dried by the desert sun and wind, scarred and toughened by uncounted gun battles, and when you look into his black eyes it&#39;s like looking down the barrels of two .44s with their hammers drawn back. He rides in the name of justice, but he lives by his own law--Bowdrie&#39;s Law. And if you&#39;re thinking about walking on the wrong side of Bowdrie Law, you&#39;d better start running.</p><p>Louis L&#x2019;Amour is undoubtedly the bestselling frontier novelist of all time. He is the only American-born author in history to receive both the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Congressional Gold Medal in honor of his life's work. He has published ninety novels; twenty-seven short-story collections; two works of nonfiction; a memoir, <b>Education of a Wandering Man</b>; and a volume of poetry, <b>Smoke from This Altar</b>. There are more than 300 million copies of his books in print worldwide.McNelly Knows<br><br>A Ranger<br>He rode up to Miller's Crossing just after sundown and stopped at the stage station. Stepping down from the saddle he stood for a moment, taking in the street, the storefronts, and the lighted saloons.<br><br>Turning abruptly he crossed the boardwalk into a saloon. The bartender looked up, swallowed hard, and then turned quickly to polishing the back bar. The loafers at the tables glanced at each other, and one picked up a deck of cards and began riffling them nervously.<br><br>Bowdrie's question warned them they had not been mistaken. "Where'll I find Noah Whipple?"<br><br>The bartender's Adam's apple bobbed. "He--they--they shot him."<br><br>"Killed?"<br><br>Bowdrie's eyes were cold. The bartender swallowed again and shifted his feet uncomfortably, staring in fascination at the man with the dimplelike scar under the cheekbone below his right eye.<br><br>"It was Aaron Fobes done it, Mr. Bowdrie. He's one o' the Ballards."<br><br>Bowdrie stood silent, waiting.<br><br>"About two this afternoon. They come ridin' in, five of them. Four got down an' come in here. The other'n stayed by the horses. They looked to be a purty salty outfit. They'd been ridin' hard by the look of the horses.<br><br>"They took a quick look around when they come in and paid no attention after. They seen everything with that first look. We all knew who they was, even without that holdup over at Benton where they killed the cashier. Everybody knows the Ballards are ridin' again and there ain't two gangs alike.<br><br>"The tall one I spotted right off. Had a blaze of white hair over his temple. That would be Clyde Ballard. He's a known man in Texas, from the Rio Grande to the Cimarron.<br><br>"The tall gent with the towhead, that would be Cousin Northup, and the slim, dark-faced youngster was Tom Ballard. The other two was Aaron Fobes and Luther Doyle."<br><br>"You seem to know them pretty well," Bowdrie commented. "Tell me more."<br><br>"Noah, he come in here three or four minutes before the Ballards got here. You maybe know about Noah. He was a good man, no trouble to anybody, but Noah was a talker. He hadn't paid no attention when the Ballards came in, just a glance and he went on talkin'.<br><br>" 'Feller come through last night an' said the Ballards was ridin' again. Used to know that Fobes up in the Nation.' We tried to catch his eye but there was no stoppin' him. 'That Fobes,' he says, 'never was no account. Poison mean, he was, even then.<br><br>" 'Time's a-comin' when they won't let thieves like that ride around the country robbin' decent people.' Noah was just talkin' like he always done but Fobes was right there to hear him.<br><br>Fobes tapped him on the shoulder. 'You talk too much, stranger,' he said, speakin' kind of low and mean."<br><br>Chick Bowdrie listened, seeing the scene all too clearly, and the inevitable ending. That was Noah, all right, always talking, meaning no harm to anybody, a decent, hardworking man with a family. At least, there was Joanie. Thinking of her his face tightened and he felt empty and kind of sick inside.<br><br>"Fobes, he said to Noah that maybe he'd like to stop the Ballards from ridin' the country? Maybe he'd like to try stoppin' them himself?<br><br>"Well, you know Noah. He might have been a talker but he was no coward. 'Maybe I would,' Whipple says. 'This country should be made safe for honest people.'<br><br>"Clyde Ballard put in then, 'Forget it, Aaron. He didn't know what he was sayin'. Let's ride.' Tom Ballard, he started for the door, Northup followin'. Noah Whipple thought it was all over, an' he dropped his hand.<br><br>"He never should have done it, but Noah was a habity man. He was reachin' for a chaw. He chawed tobacco, an' especially when he was nervous or bothered by somethin'. He reached for his tobacco an' Aaron shot him.<br><br>"It happened so quick nobody had time to move or speak. Clyde Ballard swore, and then they made a run for their horses and rode off. Noah was dead on the floor, drilled right through the heart, and him not wearin' no gun."<br><br>Chick was silent. He looked at the rye whiskey in his glass and thought of Joanie. Only a few months before he had ridden up to their ranch as close to death as a man is apt to get, with three bullet holes in him and having lost a great deal of blood.<br><br>Joanie had helped him from his horse and she and Noah had gotten him inside, then nursed him back to health. When able to ride again he had started helping around the ranch. He had not yet become a Ranger and the Whipples needed help. There was only Noah, his wife, and Joanie. They had two old cowhands but they were not much help with the rough stock.<br><br>Ranching folks weren't inclined to ask questions of those who drifted around the country. You took a man for what he was and gave him the benefit of the doubt as long as he did his share and shaped up right. Hard-faced young men wearing two tied-down guns weren't seen around very much, even in that country.<br><br>Names didn't count for much and both Whipple and Joanie knew that any man wearing two guns was either a man who needed them or a plain damned fool.<br><br>He never told them his name. To them he was simply Chick. Noah and his wife treated him like a son, and Joanie like a brother, most of the time.<br><br>It had taken him a while to regain his strength but as soon as he was able to get around he started helping, and he had always been a first-rate cowhand.<br><br>Bowdrie walked outside the saloon and stood there on the street. He knew what he had to do, and nobody had to ask his intentions. It was the kind of a country where if you worked with a man and ate his bread, you bought some of his troubles, too. The townspeople remembered him as a young cowhand who had worked for Noah, and they also knew he had come into the country in a dying condition from bullet wounds. Why or how he obtained the wounds, nobody ever asked, although curiosity was a festering thing.<br><br>He tightened his cinch, stepped back into the leather, and rode out of town.<br>Two days later Bowdrie rode back to Miller's Crossing. Folks working around town saw him ride in and they noted the brightness of the new Winchester he was carrying.<br><br>Bill Anniston, who ranched a small spread not far from the Whipples', was standing on the steps of the stage station when Bowdrie rode up. He had ridden with Bill on a roundup when the two outfits were gathering cattle.<br><br>"Bill, I'd take it as a favor if you'd ride over to the Whipples' an' see if they're all right." Bowdrie paused, rubbing the neck of the hammerhead roan. "I joined up with McNelly. I'm ridin' with the Rangers now."<br><br>"You goin' after the Ballards?"<br><br>"Time somebody did. McNelly said he'd send some men as soon as they finished what they were doin', but I told him I didn't figure I'd need no help."<br><br>As he rode away Bowdrie heard someone say, "I wonder why McNelly would take on a kid like that?"<br><br>Bill Anniston replied, "McNelly doesn't make mistakes. He knew what he was doing. Believe me, I've ridden with that boy and he's brush-wise and mountain-smart. He's no flat country yearlin'!"<br><br>Bowdrie rode south into the rough country. The wicked-looking hammerhead roan was a good horse on a long trail, a better horse than the Ballards would have. The roan liked to travel and he had a taste for rough country, a hangover from his wild mustang days.<br><br>The Ballards had not expected to be followed and their trail was plain enough. Once in a while they made a pass at hiding their trail, but nothing that would even slow Bowdrie's pace.<br><br>It was not new country to him although he had ridden it but once before. South and west were some hills known locally as the Highbinders, a rough, broken country loved by Comanches because there was not a trail approaching them that could not be watched and there was ample water if one knew where to look.<br><br>Bowdrie thought as he rode. Clyde Ballard would be irritated. Clyde did not hold with killing unless it was in a stand-up fight or in the process of a holdup. An outlaw had to have places to hide and if people were set against you you'd never last long. Often enough they were indifferent, but never if you killed a neighbor or someone they respected.<br><br>Aaron Fobes was another type entirely. There was a streak of viciousness in him. Yet Fobes would not want to cross Clyde Ballard. Not even Luther Doyle would consider that, for Clyde was a good man with a gun.<br><br>No one of them considered the possibility of pursuit. They had been a long way from Benton when the shooting took place and there was no marshal in Miller's Crossing.<br><br>With the shrewdness of a man who had known many trails, Chick Bowdrie could guess their thinking now. Clyde would be inwardly furious because the useless killing would make enemies and Miller's Crossing was a town they must avoid in future rides, and that meant some long, roundabout riding to get in and out of their hideout.<br><br>Bowdrie was in no hurry. He knew what awaited him at the ride's end and he was not riding for a record. It was almost ten days after the shooting before he rode up to the Sloacum place.<br><br>He drew rein outside the house as Tate Sloacum came striding up from the barn. "How's about some chuck?" Bowdrie suggested. "I've been thirty miles on an empty stomach."<br><br>" 'Light an' set," Sloacum said. "Turn your hoss into the corral. There's a bucket there alongside the well if you'd like to wash off some dust."<br><br>When he had washed, he ran his fingers through his hair and went up to the house. He had no Indian blood but he looked like an Apache and sometimes there was hesitance from those who did not know him. There was food in plenty but nobody talked during the meal. Eating was a serious business.<br><br>Tate Sloacum was the old man of the house, a West Virginia mountaineer by birth. He had two sons and a hawk-faced rider named Crilley. His wife was a slatternly woman with stringy red hair and a querulous voice. A daughter named Sary served them at table. She had red hair and a swish to her hips. With brothers like hers she was a girl who could get men killed.<br><br>Bowdrie was uncomfortable around women. He had known few of them well. He took in Sary with a glance and then averted his eyes and kept them averted. He knew trouble when he saw it.<br><br>At twenty-one Chick Bowdrie had been doing a man's work since he was twelve, herding cattle, breaking the wild stock, and riding the rough string. There had been little softness in his life and few friends. Once, when he could have been no older than eight, a man had stopped by the house for a meal. It was wild country with Indians about, and few traveled alone. This man did.<br><br>When Chick walked out to the corral with him he watched the man saddle up and step into the stirrup. For some reason, he hated to see him go. There had been something about the man that spoke of quiet strength.<br><br>Looking down from the saddle, the man had said, "Ride with honor, boy, ride with honor."<br><br>He did not know exactly what honor was but he never forgot the man and he was sure what the man had said was important.<br><br>A member of the Ballard gang had killed a man who befriended him, and he needed no more reason for hunting him down, and wanted no more. He had enlisted as a Ranger because it was practical. The law was coming to Texas and he preferred to ride with the law. McNelly, a shrewd judge of character, had recognized him for what he was. This young man was destined to be a hunter or one of the hunted, and McNelly reflected dryly that he'd rather hire him than lose men trying to catch him.<br><br>"We demand loyalty," he suggested. "Absolute loyalty."<br><br>"I ride for the brand," Bowdrie replied. "I never take a man's money without giving him what he's paid for."<br><br>"Where is your home?"<br><br>"Wherever I hang my hat," Bowdrie said. "I got nothing, nobody." Then he added, "I can read an' write."<br><br>"Your home?"<br><br>"Got no home. I was born near D'Hanis. Folks all gone. Mostly Injuns killed 'em."<br><br>"D'Hanis? Are you French?"<br><br>"Some. Some other blood, too. I don't know much about it. I growed up where most of the youngsters spoke French an' German as well as English."<br><br>"I know the area. Do you speak Spanish?"<br><br>"I get by. I worked cows with Mexican riders. We got along."<br><br>That was how it began. Bowdrie thought back to it now, thinking he had taken the right turn, on the right side of the law, and he knew how easy it would have been to go the other way. Sooner or later he might have killed the wrong man.<br><br>"Need a place to hole up," he told Sloacum, "a quiet place where a man can rest and let his horse eat grass."<br><br>Sloacum gestured toward the hills. "We call 'em the Highbinders. Used to be Comanches. Mostly they're gone now." He gestured toward the house. "Come up when you've unsaddled, and we'll have some grub on."<br><br>That was before he sat down. He ate well, simple food, well-cooked. The two boys disappeared when supper was over but Crilley lingered, stropping his knife on his boot sole.<br><br>"I seen you somewheres afore," he said to Bowdrie.<br><br>"I been someplace before, but I never seen you."<br><br>He did not remember ever seeing Crilley and did not care if Crilley had seen him. The cowboy might have seen him when he rode for Whipple and could take the information to Ballard if he wished. Bowdrie had to find a trail and Crilley might make it for him. Nor did he care if the Ballards were ready for him. He was ready for them, too.<br><br>He got up and Sloacum glanced at him. "You can sleep in the haymow. Ain't got an extry bed."<br><br>"I've slept in 'em before. Better'n most."<br><br>He left the house and went to the barn, where he found a big hayloft half-filled with fresh-smelling hay. He spread his blankets and bedded down, the big wide hayloft door open to the out-of-doors and showing a wide stretch of starlit sky.</p><h2>First Lady of the Confederacy: Varina Davis&#39;s Civil War</h2><p><p> When Jefferson Davis became president of the Confederacy, his wife, Varina Howell Davis, reluctantly became the First Lady. For this highly intelligent, acutely observant woman, loyalty did not come easily: she spent long years struggling to reconcile her societal duties to her personal beliefs. Raised in Mississippi but educated in Philadelphia, and a long-time resident of Washington, D.C., Mrs. Davis never felt at ease in Richmond. During the war she nursed Union prisoners and secretly corresponded with friends in the North. Though she publicly supported the South, her term as First Lady was plagued by rumors of her disaffection. </p><p> After the war, Varina Davis endured financial woes and the loss of several children, but following her husband's death in 1889, she moved to New York and began a career in journalism. Here she advocated reconciliation between the North and South and became friends with Julia Grant, the widow of Ulysses S. Grant. She shocked many by declaring in a newspaper that it was God's will that the North won the war. </p><p> A century after Varina Davis's death in 1906, Joan E. Cashin has written a masterly work, the first definitive biography of this truly modern, but deeply conflicted, woman. Pro-slavery but also pro-Union, Varina Davis was inhibited by her role as Confederate First Lady and unable to reveal her true convictions. In this pathbreaking book, Cashin offers a splendid portrait of a fascinating woman who struggled with the constraints of her time and place. </p></p><p><p>Joan E. Cashin is Associate Professor of History at Ohio State University.</p>This fascinating biography is the first full life of Varina Howell, the wife of Jefferson Davis. It is also the first detailed account of their turbulent marriage--between an adoring woman who could not always agree with her husband's ideas, and a stiff, much older man who cared nothing for his wife's opinions but demanded her total obedience. Joan Cashin has done an extraordinary amount of research--much of it in manuscripts and diaries hitherto unused by historians--and she writes with sensitivity, but without sentimentality. This is a major biography, essential for an understanding of the Confederacy and important for the history of women.<br> --David Herbert Donald, author of <i>Lincoln</i><br><br>Cashin has done justice to this compelling figure. A respected and prolific scholar of southern women's history, Cashin spent over fourteen years researching Varina Davis, painstakingly examining print sources and combing the many archives that hold relevant manuscript material. This extraordinary effort and Cashin's skill as a historian and writer are apparent on every page of this thorough, objective, and engaging book. Cashin has been careful not to impose twenty-first-century feminist values on Varina Davis, instead establishing the historical context of social, political, and gender relations and letting the documentary evidence fill in the details of Davis's life. The result is a subtle examination of an actual person, warts and all.<br> --Elizabeth Bramm Dunn (<i>North Carolina Historical Review</i> 2007-01-01)<br><br>Joan Cashin's superb new reading of the First Lady of the Confederacy offers a vivid yet balanced account of Varina Howell Davis. This is biography at its best: deep research, new material, a perceptive author, and an engrossing subject. In Cashin's hands Varina's story reaches beyond the First Lady's unique circumstances as wife, mother and widow to tell us about the old and new South. Both specialists and the general public will enjoy this exceptional portrait.<br> --Jean Baker, Professor of History, Goucher College<br><br>Fascinating in her own right, Varina Davis was in some ways a 20th century woman out of her time. Her force of personality, dedication, and independent spirit, make her in many ways more interesting than her husband. In Joan Cashin's <i>First Lady of the Confederacy: Varina Davis's Civil War</i> we have a biography worthy of the woman at last.<br> --William C. Davis, author of <i>An Honorable Defeat: The Last Days of the Confederate Government</i><br><br>Cashin is always sure-handed in showing us Varina Davis as a woman who kept an inner toughness while giving in to inflexible demands, a woman who endured a marriage that was "so many holocausts of herself." A signal scholarly achievement and a marvelous read! <br> --Jane Turner Censer, Professor of History, George Mason University<br><br>Cashin has written a smashing study--the first scholarly biography of Varina Howell Davis (1826&#x2013;1906), wife of Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Cashin follows Davis from her Mississippi childhood through her marriage, her years in Washington (when her husband served in the Senate), through the Civil War, concluding with her widowhood, during which Varina lived in New York City and supported herself by writing for newspapers. Davis had a deep commitment to family (and in later years an almost co-dependent attachment to her daughter) and intellectual sophistication. She was a passionate reader and a scintillating conversationalist. The letters quoted here sparkle with wit. Cashin also uncovers Davis's ambivalence about the Confederacy; a "wavering Confederate patriot," she believed the South was doomed from the start. Davis kept up correspondence with Northern friends and relatives throughout the Civil War, an act that could have landed her in jail. Cashin is a strong, clear writer and situates her complex subject in larger academic debates, for example, about gender in the 19th century, without getting bogged down in academese. All in all, this is a terrifically winning portrait of a fascinating woman. (starred review) (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2006-05-22)<br><br>Though Davis's life reads like a tragic novel, Cashin has taken care not to romanticize her subject...Cashin has meticulously researched her subject's long life, including her move to New York after Jefferson Davis's death in 1889 and her subsequent career as a writer.<br> --Tessa L. H. Minchew (<i>Library Journal</i> 2006-07-01)<br><br>Over the past three decades a great deal has been written about Southern women in the Civil War period, and it has left little doubt that some of them were far more restless and rebellious than their husbands and fathers would have preferred. But the case of Varina Davis takes on special meaning because she was the most prominent Southern woman of her time...Cashin's book leaves no doubt that she was in fact a considerably more interesting person than her husband, and a better one as well.<br> --Jonathan Yardley (<i>Washington Post</i> 2006-09-03)<br><br><i>First Lady of the Confederacy: Varina Davis's Civil War</i> is that rare combination of a scholarly masterpiece which is also enjoyable to read. You will come away from it glad that you took the time to get to know this woman and her life. <br> --Laurie Chambliss (<i>Civil War Interactive</i>)<br><br>Joan Cashin has dedicated years of research and writing to produce what will surely become the definitive work on this remarkable and misunderstood woman. Meticulous research in contemporary newspapers, government documents and correspondence places Varina Davis within the political and social framework of her world. The contents of nearly 600 letters reveal Davis' private thoughts on the hot-button issues of her time: women's rights, slavery and secession. Her belief that women should have at least equal rights within the bonds of marriage set her apart from her husband on numerous occasions...Varina Davis occupies a unique position in American history, and Cashin's masterful work leaves us imagining what this woman of talent and tenacity might have achieved in a later time.<br> --Mary Hatcher (<i>Charleston Post and Courier</i> 2006-10-29)</p><h2>The Art Dealers: The Powers Behind the Scene Tell How the Art World Works</h2><p>Thirty-two contemporary art dealers talk about their careers, trends in modern art, and their opinions on art history and evaluation</p><p>Laura de Coppet, a journalist who has contributed to <i>Interview</i>, lives in New York City.

(general history)</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, November 2014:</strong> Does religion lead to violence? This is the question that Karen Armstrong, the erudite former nun, asks in <i>Fields of Blood: Religion and the History of Violence</i>. Her answer is &#x201c;no&#x201d;&#x2014;or more specifically, that religion is not itself a source of violence and the problem lies more deeply in &#x201c;our human nature and the nature of the state.&#x201d; To prove her point, she covers roughly five thousand years of religious history, from Gilgamesh to the present day. Along the way, she builds the case against those who state, often without much context, that &#x201c;religion has been the cause of all the major wars in history.&#x201d; This is both an apologia and a wide-ranging and very readable lesson in the history of religion. It may not completely change the mind of everyone who reads it; but like everything Armstrong writes, it will leave them more enriched. <i>&#x2013;Chris Schluep</i></p>KAREN ARMSTRONG is the author of numerous other books on religious affairs, including &#34;The Case for God,&#34; &#34;A History of God,&#34; &#34;The Battle for God, Holy War, Islam, Buddha&#34; and &#34;The Great Transformation&#34;--and a memoir, &#34;The Spiral Staircase.&#34; Her work has been translated into 45 languages.

Looking at the entire range of human evolutionary history, Melvin Konner tells the compelling and complex story of how cross-cultural and universal characteristics of our growth from infancy to adolescence became rooted in genetically inherited characteristics of the human brain. </p><p> All study of our evolution starts with one simple truth: human beings take an extraordinarily long time to grow up. What does this extended period of dependency have to do with human brain growth and social interactions? And why is play a sign of cognitive complexity, and a spur for cultural evolution? As Konner explores these questions, and topics ranging from bipedal walking to incest taboos, he firmly lays the foundations of psychology in biology. </p><p> As his book eloquently explains, human learning and the greatest human intellectual accomplishments are rooted in our inherited capacity for attachments to each other. In our love of those we learn from, we find our way as individuals and as a species. Never before has this intersection of the biology and psychology of childhood been so brilliantly described. </p><p> "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution," wrote Dobzhansky. In this remarkable book, Melvin Konner shows that nothing in childhood makes sense except in the light of evolution. </p></p><p>Melvin Konner is Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor in the Department of Anthropology and the Program in Neuroscience and Behavioral Biology at Emory University, and author of <i>Becoming A Doctor</i>, and <i>The Evolution of Childhood</i> (Harvard).It's been a long time coming but it was worth the wait. Mel Konner's wonderful new book shows that you simply must think about our biological past to understand our psychological present. <i>The Evolution of Childhood</i> offers an extraordinary new foundation for all knowledge of human development.<br> --Michael Ruse, co-editor of <i>Evolution: The First Four Billion Years</i><br><br>Ever since his pioneering studies of infancy among Kalahari hunter-gatherers, anthropologist and physician Mel Konner has illuminated anthropology with knowledge from ethnography, sociobiology, neuroscience, and social psychology, in a search for a deep understanding of what it means to be human. This monumental book contains the best description of what play is all about that I have ever read, as well as the most comprehensive guide anywhere taking a reader through different phases of infancy, middle childhood, and adolescence. The book is the culmination of Konner's lifelong quest. It will transform the way that human development is understood and taught. <br> --Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, author of <i>Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding</i><br><br>This monumental book--more than 900 pages long, 30 years in the making, at once grand and intricate, breathtakingly inclusive and painstakingly particular--exhaustively explores the biological evolution of human behavior and specifically the behavior of children.

Perhaps because we recognize parts of ourselves in them but still find something mysterious about the behavior of those tiny human beings. <i>The Evolution of Childhood</i>, Melvin Konner's massive and massively researched new book, goes a long way in dispelling a lot of that mystery. Konner gives a detailed and expansive overview of what the fields of anthropology, evolutionary biology, psychology and genetics have taught us about human childhood. The book, in fairly accessible language, explains the evolutionary purpose of everything from babies' expressions (humans, apparently, are the only animal who can pull off the "relaxed friendly smile") to crying, early childhood outbursts and juvenile delinquency.<br> --Thomas Rogers (<i>Salon</i> 2010-05-31)<br><br>Magisterial.<br> --Rebecca Mead (<i>New Yorker</i> 2010-07-05)<br><br>Anthropologist-physician Melvin Konner's <i>The Evolution of Childhood</i> is a masterwork of scholarship. Even at over 900 pages, it should entice anyone keen for knowledge about human infancy, childhood, and adolescence and the evolution of these life stages...Konner marries biology and psychology, adds a firm grasp of our primate past, and guides our understanding of children's lives in various social contexts.<br> --Barbara King (<i>Bookslut</i> 2010-07-01)<br><br>This book is not a weekend read...If you plan to read this book through, take a little each day and savor the delights it bestows. Well worth the read.<br> --D. Wayne Dworsky (<i>San Francisco Book Review</i> 2010-09-23)<br><br>This book is undeniably a tour de force. Indeed, Konner is perhaps the only scholar who is as comfortable describing cultural change, or evolution in its broad quasi-philosophical outlines, as he is defining the complex biochemical and statistical correlates of behavior. One of his writerly charms is that he is ever seer and scientist. He marvels as he describes. He also renders the boundaries among disciplines porous. He scurries from one to another, insisting on their enmeshment, whether it be ethology, cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary or developmental psychology, endocrinology, or cultural anthropology. He draws on all these fields to address the story of our inordinately long, and, compared to those of other species, "strangely-shaped" childhoods, and to discover how our childhood evolved to make us what we are.<br> --Michele Pridmore-Brown (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i> 2010-10-01)<br><br>Konner places childhood firmly within an evolutionary framework in his magisterial book...Konner is an excellent tour guide to the sacred lands of childhood. He has produced a scholarly, detailed and beautifully written study...<i>The Evolution of Childhood</i> shows that the pleasures of life are linked to the evolutionary imperatives of reproduction and survival, and that we are starting to understand their underlying neural mechanisms.<br> --Morten Kringelbach (<i>Nature</i> 2010-10-21)</p><h2>Jack of Fables Vol. 1: The (Nearly) Great Escape</h2><p>The first five issues of the popular FABLES spin-off series are collected in this amazing new volume! Last seen hitchhiking from Hollywood, Jack&#39;s now a wayward Fable in the heartland of America. His extreme road stories and encounters with other notorious, renegade Fables are just a few of the situations in store for this fan-favorite character.</p><p>Bill Willingham is a writer and artist whose work includes Coventry and The Sandman Presents. He is currently writer/artist of Shadowpact. Matthew Sturges&#39; work includes the novel Midwinter and anthologies Live Without A Net and Revolution SF. Jack of Fables is his first comics series. Tony Akins&#39; work has appeared in a variety of comics and graphic novels including Fables, Elementals, GI Joe, Hellblazer: Papa Midnite and Star Wars.Willingham first created a contemporary world inhabited by fairy tale characters in his series, <i>Fables</i>. He continues that success with Sturges, who co-writes this recent spinoff. A new story line further develops Jack Horner's escapades in Hollywood and establishes him as the most dangerous Fable loose in the "mundy"&#x2014;short for "mundane"&#x2014;world. Jack is forced into the Golden Boughs Retirement Community, a jail of sorts where Fables are imprisoned until society-at-large forgets about them, thereby diminishing their magic powers. Enlisting the support of Goldilocks and a cage full of fairies, Jack plans the entire retirement community's escape. Willingham and Sturges give Jack a bad-boy attitude, making him an everyman hero that readers won't always identify with, but will enjoy watching flub and fake his way to freedom, complete with clever riffs on the Turtle and the Hare, the Toothfairy, Mother Goose and Humpty Dumpty. Readers will enjoy this more if they first familiarize themselves with Willingham's established Fables world (<i>Legends in Exile</i>, <i>Wolves</i>, etc.). Rated for mature readers, the tale includes sex, nudity, corruption, so it's got a little bit of everything that any sophisticated comics fan will enjoy. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

THE most collectible volume in the series due to a print error and a limited print run. "Joanne Rowling" is printed as author on the copyright page, not "J.K. Rowling" as preferred by the publicist. This was not corrected until later printings. The first print run (or impression) was limited to approximately 4,000 copies (some dealers say even fewer). First printings are identified by the presence of a full number line 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 on the copyright page. The second print run also contains the "Joanne Rowling" credit and was also relatively small, making it an affordable alternative to the first printing for many collectors. Prices decline with subsequent printings and editions. Product details: Bright green cloth-bound boards with gilt lettering, gilt-stamped JK Rowling signature &amp; gilted page-ends; pictorial onlay; full-color harlequin endpapers; unique typeset, illustrations and paper quality all make this a valuable addition to any collector's library. Ships well-packaged and protected.</p><p>For most children, summer vacation is something to look forward to. But not for our 13-year-old hero, who's forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard "accidentally" causes the Dursleys' dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. <p> As it turns out, Harry isn't punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering, not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately, there are four more in the works.

Convicted of killing thirteen people with a single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent to the Dark Lord, Voldemort. <br>Now he has escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter's defeat of You-Know-Who was Black's downfall as well. And the Azkban guards heard Black muttering in his sleep, "He's at Hogwarts...he's at Hogwarts." <br>Harry Potter isn't safe, not even within the walls of his magical school, surrounded by his friends.

Perhaps, it could be argued, <i>too</i> famous, at least for his fiction's own good. Like those of Hemingway or any other writer similarly loved, imitated, parodied, and reviled, these stories can sometimes produce the sense of reading pastiche. "A man without hands came to the door to sell me a photograph of my house." "That morning she pours Teacher's over my belly and licks it off. That afternoon she tries to jump out the window." "My friend Mel McGinnis was talking. Mel is a cardiologist, and sometimes that gives him the right." What other writer ever produced first sentences like these? They are like doors into Carverworld, where everyone speaks in simple declarative phrases, no one ever stops at one beer, and failure or violence are the true outcomes of the American dream.<p> Yet these stories bear careful re-reading, like any truly important and enduring work. For one thing, Carver is one of the few writers who can make desperation--cutting your ex-wife's telephone cord in the middle of a conversation, standing on your own roof chunking rocks while a man with no hands takes your picture--deeply <i>funny</i>. Then there is the sheer craft that went into their creation. Despite their seeming simplicity, his tales are as artfully constructed as poems--and like poems, the best of them can make your breath catch in your throat. In the title piece, for instance, after the gin has been drunk, after the stories have been told, after the tensions in the room have come to the surface and subsided again, there comes a moment of strange lightness and peace: "I could hear my heart beating. I could hear everyone's heart. I could hear the human noise we sat there making, not one of us moving, not even when the room went dark." </p><p> Much of what happens in <i>What We Talk About When We Talk About Love</i> (1981) happens offstage, and we're left with tragedy's props: booze, instant coffee, furniture from a failed marriage, cigarettes smoked in the middle of the night. This is not merely a matter of technique. Carver leaves out a great deal, but that's only a measure of his characters' vulnerability, the nerve endings his stories lay bare. To say anything more, one feels, would simply hurt too much. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>In his second collection of stories, as in his first, Carver&#39;s characters are peripheral people--people without education, insight or prospects, people too unimaginative to even give up. Carver celebrates these men and women.</p><h2>One Tree Hill: #1 The Beginning</h2><p>ONE TREE HILL is the latest Dawson's-style hit on The WB.

This much loved author and illustrator of nonfiction books lives in Vermont with her husband, where they also produce maple syrup.PreS-Gr. 1. Valentine's Day gets Gibbons' treatment--simple, direct, and illustrated with busily bright watercolors, here punctuated with lots of red hearts. Each spread begins with the sentence "Valentine's Day Is . . ., which is completed with a word or phrase that points out a different aspect of the holiday. For instance, "Valentine's Day is . . . a celebration of friendship and love" or "Valentine cards" or "flowers" or "candy." Then each thought is expanded. Sometimes the explanations are a bit truncated; at other times, they are a little off. It seems odd, for example, to talk about St. Valentine being jailed for his religious beliefs (and named a saint) without mentioning his religion. Likewise, the line "Everyone gets lots of cards" seems insensitive to the many children who don't. But mostly this is a good introduction to a holiday that children become aware of early on. The pictures are filled with kids having a good time, and cards, gifts, and candy, and other symbols of the season decorate the pages.

Yet this ancient sacrament has also been a source of controversy and oppression, culminating, as prize-winning historian John Cornwell reveals in <i>The Dark Box</i>, with the scandal of clerical child abuse. Drawing on extensive historical sources, contemporary reports, and first-hand accounts, Cornwell takes a hard look at the long evolution of confession.<br><br>The papacy made annual, one-on-one confession obligatory for the first time in the 13th century. In the era that followed, confession was a source of spiritual consolation as well as sexual and mercenary scandal. During the 16th century, the Church introduced the confession box to prevent sexual solicitation of women, but this private space gave rise to new forms of temptation, both for penitents and confessors. Yet no phase in the story of the sacrament has had such drastic consequences as a historic decree by Pope Pius X in 1910. In reaction to the spiritual perils of the new century, Pius sought to safeguard the Catholic faithful by lowering the age at which children made their first confession from their early teens to seven, while exhorting all Catholics to confess frequently instead of annually. This sweeping, inappropriately early imposition of the sacrament gave priests an unprecedented and privileged role in the lives of young boys and girls?a role that a significant number would exploit in the decades that followed.<br><br>A much-needed account of confession&#x2019;s fraught history, <i>The Dark Box</i> explores the sources of the sacrament&#x2019;s harm and shame, while recognizing its continuing power to offer consolation and reconciliation.<br></p><p><b>John Cornwell</b> is a Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge.

With an unerring eye for the American scene and an omnivorous ear for American talk, he mocked such sacrosanct institutions as the small town (<i>Main Street</i>), business (<i>Babbitt</i>), medicine (<i>Arrowsmith</i>), and religion (<i>Elmer Gantry</i>). His shrewdly observed characters became part of the American gallery, and his titles became part of the language.<br><br>Despite his books&#x2019; innate subversiveness, they were bestsellers and widely discussed&#x2014;&#x2013;and almost as widely damned. They had small-towners worried about being called &#x201c;Main Streeters,&#x201d; preachers fearful of being branded &#x201c;Elmer Gantrys,&#x201d; and Babbitts defiant of being labeled &#x201c;Babbitts.&#x201d; Lewis touched a nerve among Americans who secretly yearned for something more from life than hustling, making money, and buying new cars.<br><br>Lewis danced along the fault line between the old, small-town, frugal, conservative, fundamentalist America and the modernist, big-business-dominated, youth-obsessed, advertising-powered consumer society that was reshaping the American character in the iconoclastic 1920s.<br><br>For all his use of humor and satire, Lewis probed serious themes: feminism (<i>The Job, Main Street</i>, <i>Ann Vickers</i>), commercial pressures on science (<i>Arrowsmith</i>), racial prejudice (<i>Kingsblood Royal</i>), and native fascism (<i>It Can&#x2019;t Happen Here</i>). In 1930, he became the first American to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, but he feared he could never live up to it. In his heart, he was a scold with a conscience, a harsh truth-teller who laughed out loud. His novels, born out of a passionate conviction that America could be better, are thus as alive today as when they were written.<br><br>Bringing to bear newly uncovered correspondence, diaries, and criticism, Richard Lingeman, distinguished biographer of Theodore Dreiser, paints a sympathetic portrait&#x2014;&#x2013;in all its multihued contradictions&#x2014;&#x2013;of a seminal American writer who could be inwardly the loneliest of men and outwardly as gregarious as George Follansbee Babbitt himself. Lingeman writes with sympathy and understanding about Lewis&#x2019;s losing struggle with alcoholism; his stormy marriages, including one to the superwoman Dorothy Thompson, whose fame as a newspaper columnist in the 1930s outshone Lewis&#x2019;s fading star as a novelist; and his wistful, autumnal love for an actress more than thirty years younger than he.<br><br><i>Sinclair Lewis: Rebel from Main Street</i> evokes with color and verve the gaudy life and times of this prairie Mercutio out of Sauk Centre, Minnesota.</p><p>"As a sequel to his magisterial biography of Theodore Dreiser, Richard Lingeman has put forth, at long last, the definitive life of Sinclair Lewis, the other genius-curmudgeon of our literature. It's a touch of fate, I think, that Lingeman, out of midwestern provincial Crawfordsville, is just the boy to celebrate the scourges of our sacrosanct, who came from equally endowed American towns, Terre Haute and Sauk Centre.

Original. 10,000 first printing. BOMC Crafter&#39;s Choice.</p><p>Stitch pattern collections are the basic building blocks used by knitwear designers. Unlike many earlier pattern collections that relied exclusively on written instructions of the "knit one, purl one" variety, Stanfield's compilation of 332 patterns features charted patterns and close-up photographs throughout. Patterns in chart form have only recently come to be preferred by many creative knitters, perhaps because charts provide a pictorial representation of how the finished piece will actually look. Stanfield divides the collection into five major groups: knit and purl, cable, lace and bobble, twisted stitches, and "other." Throughout, she emphasizes charts, using written instructions only when introducing new material. This book has much to admire, including myriad elegant stitch patterns the author has rescued from obscurity, excellent photography, and a thumbnail index with a small photograph of each pattern linked by number to the complete pattern.

The lead story, "The Night Flier," is by Stephen King but is one of the weakest in the book, a vampire tale with a long windup and a brief punch. "Having a Woman at Lunch" by Paul Hazel is a carefully written, ironic account of a group of diffident males who find a macabre way of dealing with a woman who infiltrates their circle. Clive Barker's "Coming to Grief" is one of this writer's quieter stories, which clearly shows the influence of Ramsey Campbell, himself represented by "Next Time You'll Know Me," about a homicidal paranoic for whom it is difficult not to feel sorry. "Food" by Thomas Tessier tells of an obese woman undergoing a metamorphosis and the unfortunate man who loves her. Other excellent contributions are by M.

Hungering for more resources amid the turmoil, the Horde has pressed into Ashenvale to feed its burgeoning war machine. There, acting warchief Garrosh Hellscream has employed a brutal new tactic to conquer the region and crush its night elf defenders, a move that will cripple the Alliance&#x2019;s power throughout the World of Warcraft.<br><br>Unaware of the disaster brewing in Ashenvale, the night elves&#x2019; legendary leaders, High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind and Archdruid Malfurion Stormrage, conduct a summit near Darnassus in order to vote the proud worgen of Gilneas into the Alliance. However, resentment of Gilneas and its ruler, Genn Greymane, runs deep in Stormwind&#x2019;s King Varian Wrynn. His refusal to forgive Genn for closing his nation off from the rest of the world years ago endangers more than just the summit: it threatens to unravel the Alliance itself.<br><br>Varian&#x2019;s animosity is only one of many unsettling developments in Darnassus. An uneasiness creeps over the once-immortal night elves as the first of them fall victim to the infirmities of age. While they cope with their mortality, tensions flare over the reintroduction of the Highborne, formerly the highest caste of night elf nobility, into their society. Many night elves are unable to pardon the Highborne for the destruction unleashed on Azeroth millennia ago by their reckless use of magic.<br><br>When a murdered Highborne is discovered on the outskirts of Darnassus, Malfurion and Tyrande move to stop further bloodshed and unrest by appointing one of the night elves&#x2019; most cunning and skilled agents to find the killer: the renowned warden Maiev Shadowsong. Yet with all that is transpiring in Darnassus, the Alliance might be powerless to stop the relentless new warchief Garrosh from seizing the whole of Ashenvale.</p><p>Richard A.

In its Hindi form of <i>jangal,</i> it denotes any area of uncultivated land. Indian jungles are not necessarily forested, and today less so than ever. But well away from centres of population there do still survive a few extensive and well-wooded jungle tracts, especially in eastern and central India. Often they are classed as game sanctuaries, a designation which implies few facilities for the visitor but some much-advertised protection for the wildlife.</p><p>Here tigers and elephants yet roam, hornbills flap about in the canopy like clumsy pterodactyls, and hump-backed boar rootle aggressively through the leaf mould. In the dry season a safari might seem an attractive prospect. But be warned: 'dry' is high-baked. Like splintering glass, dead leaves explode underfoot to alert the animals. The tracks of crumbled dirt are hard to follow, spiked with ferocious thorns, and spanned by man-size webs patrolled by bird-size spiders.</p><p>The wet season is worse still. Then, the vegetation erupts. The tracks become impassable, and the air fills with insects. Only fugitives take to the jungle in the monsoon. Fugitives and, in days gone by when maps were rare, surveyors. In the year 1819, in just such a tract between the Godavari and Kistna rivers in what is now the south-eastern state of Andhra Pradesh, an English Lieutenant, lately attached to the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India and uncommonly keen to make his mark, underwent a baptism of fever.</p><p>Matters had gone badly for the twenty-eight-year-old Lieutenant from the start. Barely a month into this, his first season in the field, he had been confronted by a mutiny. 'The infliction of corporal punishment is an odious task,' he noted. But it was either that or abandoning the assignment. His escort obviously knew the perils of the monsoonal jungle and had seized every chance of escaping from the camp back to the city of Hyderabad. Something had to be done. Not without misgivings, the Lieutenant ordered one of these defaulters to be thrashed, whereupon the whole troop, about forty in number, took up their weapons and announced that they would decamp <i>en masse.</i> The British bluff had been called; in this insignificant and still today unfashionable comer of the subcontinent the myth of empire was at stake.</p><p>As might be inferred, by 18 19 the British were already well on their way to becoming masters of India. Some areas had been won by conquest and were now under direct British rule; others were merely attached by treaty and remained nominally independent states under their own rulers. This was the case with the large principality of Hyderabad, through whose densest jungle the Kistna and Godavari rivers converged on the coast. Special permission had been obtained for the Great Trigonometrical Survey to operate in Hyderabad; but in 'a native state' the standards of subservience exacted in areas under direct British rule could not be taken for granted.</p><p>In fact, they could seemingly not be taken at all other than at the point of a gun. The mutineers, who now repaired to the nearby shade of a mango orchard, comprised a detachment of local troops lent by Nizam Sikander Jah of Hyderabad to protect and assist the British survey. In addition, the Survey had its own escort of twelve men who had been recruited in British territory, were paid out of the Survey's budget and had already amassed many years of loyal service. This in-house escort was now ordered to load muskets and take aim at the mutineers. A volley into their midst was threatened if they did not immediately surrender.</p><p>The ploy worked. The mutineers submitted, and this time the Lieutenant offered no apology for calling for the cane. Three men were publicly flogged, then dismissed; and thus, the Lieutenant tells us, 'was settled, very early in my career, a disputed point which had been a source of constant contention and annoyance to Colonel Lambton ever since his entering into the Nizam's territory'.</p><p>Colonel Lambton was the originator and now Superintendent of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. For seventeen years he had been spinning a web of giant geometry across the Indian peninsula without ever having had to thrash any of its teeming peoples. Tactful, patient and indestructible, Lambton seemed immune to India's frustrations, the result of a long wilderness experience in North America and of an attachment to science so obsessive and disinterested that even his critics were inclined to indulge him. Colonel Lambton beguiled India; but Lieutenant George Everest, his eager new assistant, chastised it.</p><p>The name, incidentally, was pronounced not 'Ever-rest' (like 'cleverest'), but 'Eve-rest' (like 'cleave-rest'). That was how the family always pronounced it, and the Lieutenant would not have thanked you for getting it wrong. Years later a fellow officer would make the mistake of calling him a 'Kumpass Wala'. No offence was meant. 'Kumpass Wala', or 'compass-wallah', was an accepted Anglo-Indian term for a surveyor. Everest, however, accepted nothing of the sort. He detested what he called 'nicknames' and, though it was not perhaps worth a dawn challenge, he demanded -- and received -- abject apologies. Getting on the wrong side of George Everest was an occupational hazard with which even British India would only slowly come to terms.</p><p>With the mutiny quelled and the mutineers 'finding that, when they knew me better, good behaviour was a perfect security against all unkindness', a self-righteous Everest pressed on for the jungles beside the Kistna. It was July, the month when the monsoon breaks. On time, the heavens duly opened just as he climbed a hill to his first observation post.</p><p>Survey work was conducted during and immediately after the monsoon because, regardless of the discomfort, it was only then that the dust was laid and the heat-haze dispersed. In the interludes of bright sunshine, the atmosphere was at its clearest. . .</p></p><h2>The Warehouse: A Novel</h2><p><b><i>Cloud isn&#x2019;t just a place to work. It&#x2019;s a place to live.

He lives on Staten Island with his wife and daughter.<p><b><i>Paxton</i></b></p><p>Paxton pressed his hand against the front window of the ice-cream parlor. The menu board on the wall inside promised homemade flavors. Graham cracker and chocolate marshmallow and peanut butter fudge.</p><p>Flanking it, on one side, was a hardware store called Pop&#x2019;s, and on the other was a diner with a chrome and neon sign he couldn&#x2019;t quite make out. Delia&#x2019;s? Dahlia&#x2019;s?</p><p>Paxton looked up and down the stretch of the main road. It was so easy to imagine the street bustling with people. All the life this place used to hold. It was the kind of town that could inspire feelings of nostalgia on the first visit.</p><p>Now it was an echo fading in the white sunlight.</p><p>He turned back to the ice-cream parlor, the only business on the strip not boarded up with weathered plywood. The window was hot to the touch where the sun hit it and coated in a layer of grit.</p><p>Looking inside, at the dusty stacks of flared tin cups and the empty stools and the fallow refrigerators, Paxton wanted to feel some kind of regret, about what this place must have meant to the town that surrounded it.</p><p>But he had reached the limit of his sadness when he stepped off the bus. Just the act of being there was stretching his skin to bursting, like an overfilled balloon.</p><p>Paxton hitched his bag over his shoulder and turned back into the horde shuffling down the sidewalk, trampling the grass jutting through the cracks in the concrete. There were still people coming up in the rear--older folks, people nursing injuries so they couldn&#x2019;t walk as well.</p><p>Forty-seven people had gotten off the bus. Forty-seven people, not including him. About halfway through the two-hour ride, when there was nothing left on his phone to capture his attention, he&#x2019;d counted. Heavy-shouldered men with the callused hands of day laborers. Stooped office workers grown soft from years of hunching at keyboards. One girl couldn&#x2019;t have been more than seventeen. She was short and curvy, with long brown braids that reached down to her lower back and skin the color of milk. She wore an old lavender pantsuit, two sizes too big, the fabric faded and stretched from years of washing and wear. The sliver of an orange tag, like the kind used in secondhand stores, stuck out from its collar.</p><p>Everyone carried luggage. Battered roller suitcases wobbling on uneven pavement. Bags strapped to backs or slung over shoulders. Everyone sweating from exertion. The sun baked the top of Paxton&#x2019;s head.</p><p>It must have been well past a hundred degrees. Sweat ran down Paxton&#x2019;s legs, pooling in his underarms, making his clothes stick. Which was exactly why he wore black pants and a white shirt, so the sweat wouldn&#x2019;t show as much. The white-haired man next to him, the one who looked like a college professor put out to pasture, his beige suit was the color of wet cardboard.</p><p>Hopefully the processing center was close. Hopefully it was cool. He just wanted to be inside. He could taste it on his tongue: dust blowing from ruined fields, no longer strong enough to keep a grip on anything. It had been cruel of the bus driver to drop them at the edge of town. He was probably staying close to the interstate to conserve gas, but still.</p><p>The line ahead shifted, drifting to the right at the intersection. Paxton dug in harder. He wanted to stop to pull a bottle of water out of his bag, but pausing at the ice-cream parlor had been an indulgence. There were now more people ahead of him than behind.</p><p>As he neared the corner, a woman launched past him, clipping his side, making enough contact he almost stumbled. She was older, Asian, with a mop of white hair on her head and a leather satchel looped around her shoulder, making a hard push for the front of the pack. But the effort proved to be too much and within a couple of feet she tripped, went down hard on her knee.</p><p>The people around her stepped to the side, gave her room, but didn&#x2019;t stop. Paxton knew why. A little voice in his head screamed, Keep walking, but of course he couldn&#x2019;t, so he helped her get to her feet. Her bare knee was scratched red, a long trail of blood running down her leg to her tennis shoe, so thick the line was black.</p><p>She looked at him, barely nodded, and took off. Paxton sighed.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome,&#x201d; he said, not loud enough for her to hear.</p><p>He checked behind him. The people at the back were picking up the pace. Walking with a renewed sense of effort, probably at the sight of someone going down to the ground. There was blood in the air. Paxton hitched the bag again and took off at a brisk pace, aiming hard for that corner. He turned and found a large theater with a white marquee. The stucco on the front of the building was crumbling to reveal patches of weather-worn brick.</p><p>Broken neon glass letters formed an uneven pattern along the top of the marquee.</p><p>r-i-v-r-v-i-e.</p><p>Paxton figured it was supposed to spell out Riverview, even though there didn&#x2019;t seem to be any rivers nearby, but then again, maybe there used to be. Parked outside the theater was a mobile air-conditioning unit, the sleek vehicle humming, pumping cold air through a sealed tube into the building. Paxton followed the crowd toward the long row of open doors. As he got closer, the doors on the end closed, leaving a few in the middle still open.</p><p>He pushed forward, nearly running the final few steps, aiming for the middle. As he stepped through, more doors slammed behind him. The sun disappeared and the cool air enveloped him and it felt like a kiss.</p><p>He shivered, looked back. Saw the last door close, and a middle-aged man with a pronounced limp was left out in the blazing sun. The first thing the man did was deflate. Shoulders slumped, bag dropped to the ground. Then the tension returned to his spine and he stepped forward, smacking his palm against the door. He must have been wearing a ring because it made a sharp crack, like the glass might break.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; he yelled, his voice muffled. &#x201c;Hey. You can&#x2019;t do this. I came all the way out here.&#x201d;</p><p>Crack, crack, crack.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey.&#x201d;</p><p>A man in a gray shirt that said RapidHire on the back in white letters approached the rejected applicant. He placed a hand on the man&#x2019;s shoulder. Paxton couldn&#x2019;t read lips, but he assumed it was the same thing spoken to the woman who&#x2019;d gotten turned away from the bus. She was the last person on line and the doors closed in her face, and a man in a RapidHire shirt appeared and said: &#x201c;There is no last place. You have to want to work at Cloud. You are free to apply again in one month&#x2019;s time.&#x201d;</p><p>Paxton turned away from the scene. He couldn&#x2019;t find more room for his own sadness--certainly he couldn&#x2019;t muster space for anyone else&#x2019;s.</p></p><h2>Rites and Symbols of Initiation: The Mysteries of Birth and Rebirth</h2><p>Organizing data from cultures the world over, Mircea Eliade, one of the preeminent interpreters of world religion in the twentieth century, lays out the basic patterns of initiation: group puberty rites, entrance into secret cults, shamanic instruction, individual visions, and heroic rites of passage. The vast information assembled here transcends usual scholarship. Eliade always affirms the greater experience in all initiation the indissoluble tie between humans and the cosmos of gods, spirits, animals, ancestors, and nature. As Michael Meade writes in his foreword, Eliade fervently worked at keeping the doors of perception open to the world of sacred symbols and creative ritual. Through his insistence that we are each the necessary inheritors of a vast sacred heritage, he has acted as a spiritual elder and distant mentor to me and many students of myth and ritual. Like an archeologist of symbols, he has unearthed, preserved, and found new meanings in the rites of our ancestors.</p><p>Text: English (translation) <br> Original Language: French</p><h2>High Altitude Baking: 200 Delicious Recipes &amp; Tips for Great Cookies, Cakes, Breads &amp; More</h2><p>Put an end to your high altitude frustrations today!

For thousands of years flags have represented our hopes and dreams. We wave them. Burn them. March under their colors. And still, in the twenty-first century, we die for them. Flags fly at the UN, on Arab streets, from front porches in Texas. They represent the politics of high power as well as the politics of the mob.<br> <br> In nine chapters (covering the USA, UK, Europe, Middle East, Asia, Africa, Latin America, international flags, and flags of terror), Tim Marshall&#x2019;s <i>A Flag Worth Dying For</i> examines the systems of symbols that represent nation states and non-state actors (including ISIS, Hezbollah, and Hamas), and how they figure in diplomatic relations and events today.<br> <br> Drawing on more than twenty-five years of global reporting experience to reveal the true meaning behind the symbols that unite us&#x2014;and divide us&#x2014;<i>A Flag Worth Dying For</i> is a winning combination of current affairs, politics, and world history.</p><p>Tim Marshall is a leading authority on foreign affairs with more than 30 years of reporting experience.

Now, to keep the child she's come to love, she'll have to give up her hard-won freedom and become his wife. But giving Rand her heart? That, she could never have expected...</p><p>Setting: Chicago 1871<p> Sensuality: 7</p><p> In one catastrophic night, unconventional debutante Lucy Hathaway meets and propositions powerful banker Randolph Higgins, risks her life to save a baby girl, then loses her father and the family fortune in the chaos of the great Chicago fire. Five years later, she's older, wiser, and the proud owner of The Firebrand, a bookstore that caters to suffragettes and free thinkers. Fate throws her once again into the path of Randolph Higgins when she must apply to his bank for an extension on the loan that financed her bookstore. She discovers that Randolph is now a scarred, bitter, divorced man, and that he believes his daughter died in the fire. One glance at the photo on his desk tells her that Maggie, the child she saved and adopted that terrible night, is his lost daughter.</p><p> Lucy's strong sense of honor drives her to tell Randolph the truth. Now the conservative banker and the fiercely independent Lucy must deal with each other for Maggie's sake. Despite the resulting clash of wills and differing political views, the powerful attraction that drew them together five years earlier still exists. Can these two stubborn, opinionated people find a way to nurture a life together, for the sake of Maggie and their own battered hearts?</p><p> <i>The Firebrand</i> pits a strong heroine reluctant to abandon her independence against a hero grounded in traditional concepts of marriage and female roles. The rich details of life in 1870s Chicago, well-developed secondary characters, and the exploration of the women's suffrage movement all add up to making <i>The Firebrand</i> a rare treat.

In February. In the Pacific Northwest. After thawing herself out, the author put on her lipstick and vacuumed the living room. Why? Because on the tiny island where she lives, news travels fast. She knew her girlfriends would show up momentarily - which they did - with the customary champagne and bags of Cheetos. She toasted her loyal readers, whose unflagging interest in her books propelled her sales upward. She toasted her friends and family as well, since they have always been the source of her inspiration. From the very start, her writings have illuminated the everyday dramas of ordinary people.

Via her readers' letters and e-mails, she realized that through her journal she had become an identifying voice for women around the world. However, along with recognition came a certain pressure to uphold her new image. Overwhelmed by her attempt to live up to what she thought she had to become, Sabrina decided to head out on her own. She chose as her destination Italy, a place she had always dreamed and written about, a place she felt she could go to "recolor" herself. In her journey she discovered a universal identity with other travelers and a particular kinship with the women she met. But back home she struggled to keep her newfound confidence intact as she navigated her life.<br><br>Harrison writes and illustrates with a powerful and creative voice. Her thoughts are real and brave. She explores with sensitivity questions of love, faith, growing pains, being true to oneself, and what it means to be unique.

In it, Dr. Tinus Smits shares his vision that homeopathy can address the universal human experiences of coming into incarnation from the world of spirit. These &#34;universal layers&#34; include coming into the body; feeling unconditional mother love - or not, feeling abandoned, unworthy and insecure; and staying centered within ourselves while maintaining our oneness with the universe. The layers also include common issues such as the trauma of abuse, and of the abused who may in turn become an abuser. Each of these seven layers can be resolved by a single remedy; and as one layer resolves, another one often emerges. This makes Inspiring Homeopathy a simple system to heal some of the deepest issues our clients face. Tinus sheds new light on some classic remedies, such as Rhus tox, which already has the &#34;delusion he will be murdered.&#34; In Tinus&#39; system, Rhus tox helps heal every imaginable trauma, from sexual abuse and incest to torture, imprisonment and violence. He also developed a new form of mother&#39;s milk - Lac maternum, which expands on the &#34;floating sensation&#34; typical of milks to become the remedy for groundedness. Inspiring Homeopathy introduces new remedies so useful they may become modern polychrests. Vernix caseosa, made from the waxy substance protecting a newborn&#39;s skin, has quickly become a widely used remedy for hypersensitives, for people with porous energetic boundaries, and for practitioners to protect themselves from their clients&#39; energies. Inspiring Homeopathy is also a frequent component of CEASE therapy, Tinus&#39; brilliant method for reversing autism by systematically detoxifying vaccines, medications and environmental toxins. In this protocol, an Inspiring remedy often alternates with the detox remedies.</p><p></p><h2>The Compleat Angler (Barre)</h2><p>Although the 1653 world of Izaak Walton was far different from our own, his advice on fishing has never gone out of style. For those who fish or just love the outdoors, this classic of English literature, loved for the character of its author as well as the lore he imparts, is a treasure. Includes a new Introduction by Thomas McGuane and charming illustrations throughout by the great Arthur Rackham.</p><p>For a book to stay in print for nearly 350 years, its merits must continually entice and satisfy. <i>The Compleat Angler</i> qualifies on both counts. On the most obvious level, it remains as good a primer on fishing as any angler would want. But its most enduring distinction is hinted at in the subtitle--"the Contemplative Man's Recreation." Izaak Walton's sometimes convoluted 17th-century grammar can still reel in our imaginations with his graceful evocations of a life free from hurly-burly in the company of friends intent on physical and moral sustenance. "He that hopes to be a good Angler must not only bring an inquiring, searching, observing wit," suggests the master, "but he must bring a large measure of hope and patience.... Doubt not but Angling will prove to be so pleasant, that it will prove to be like a virtue, a reward to itself." Just like Walton's magnificent literary catch. --<i>Jeff Silverman</i>[[The first unabridged cast reading. Features original song compositions.

"He still loves you, Mom."</p> <p>Bethanne's spoon hovered over her bowl of soup as they sat at a window table in their favorite cafe. This wasn't actually news and shouldn't have come as any surprise. <em>Didn't</em> come as any surprise. She'd seen the signs, as recently as this morning. These days Grant was inventing excuses to call her.</p> <p>Six years ago her world had imploded when her husband confessed that he'd fallen in love with another woman. With barely a backward glance, Grant had walked out&#x2014;out of their home, their marriage, their lives. And now he wanted back in.</p> <p>"Don't you have anything to say?" Annie asked, toying with her fork. She watched her mother intently.</p> <p>"Not really." She swallowed the soup and lowered her spoon for another taste.</p> <p>Annie, it seemed, had forgotten. But not Bethanne.</p> <p>The morning Grant told her he wanted a divorce would stay in her mind forever. He couldn't seem to get away from her fast enough. He'd retained a lawyer and advised her to do the same, then coldly informed her that all future communication would be through their lawyers. The less contact with her and their children, the better, he'd said. A clean break was best.</p> <p>Grant's decision had struck Bethanne with the force and unpredictability of a hurricane. She'd stumbled blindly through the next few months, trying to hold her family together, clinging to the semblance of normality while her world disintegrated around her. "You really don't have anything to say?" Annie prodded.</p> <p>"No," Bethanne said shortly. She swallowed another spoonful of soup and reached for the herb scone. "What disturbs me is that your father would let you do his talking for him."</p> <p>Annie had the grace to look chastened, but she pushed her food away as if she'd suddenly lost her appetite.</p> <p>At one time Bethanne had dreamed Grant would regret what he'd done, that he'd seek her forgiveness and come crawling back to her. She'd wanted him to suffer for the way he'd treated her, for the hurt he'd inflicted when he'd turned his back on their children.</p> <p>But in the years since the divorce, Bethanne had gradually found her footing and, in the process, discovered a self she didn't know existed&#x2014;a stronger, independent Bethanne, a woman forged in the fire of despair. Now her two children were on their own; her oldest, Andrew, was engaged to be married in a few weeks, following his graduation from law school. As for her daughter, Annie was a year from obtaining her MBA. She worked part-time with Bethanne on the creative end of the party business Bethanne had established in the wake of her divorce.</p> <p>During her twenty years of marriage, Bethanne had become known for her lavish and inventive parties. She'd taken pride in making Grant look good by hosting unforgettable events for clients and potential clients&#x2014;an invitation to Grant's home became a sought-after privilege in certain circles. Her birthday parties for Andrew and Annie were legendary. But never once had she</p> <p>dreamed that her party-giving skills would eventually be parlayed into such a success.</p> <p>She'd started the business, which she called simply Parties, as a way of making enough money to continue living in their family home, although she'd had to take out a substantial second mortgage to get Parties off the ground. Grant had paid the required support, but depending on that would've meant moving to a smaller house in a different neighborhood. If ever her children needed stability, she knew, it was in the period after the divorce. She'd since paid off both mortgages.</p> <p>To Bethanne's astonishment, the business had taken off immediately. She'd started small, with themed birthday parties for children. The Alice in Wonderland Tea Party had been the most popular of the dozens of concepts she'd created. With busy schedules, parents were looking for an easy, economical way to make birthday parties special. Bethanne's company had filled that need.</p> <p>Currently, there were five Parties stores in the Seattle area, including the original location, and she was considering a deal that offered national franchising opportunities. The key was to keep the ideas fresh and the prices reasonable. This past winter she'd added a "birthday party in a box"&#x2014;more scaled-down, do-it-yourself versions of her trademarked theme parties.</p> <p>A year earlier Bethanne had hired Julia Hayden as her corporate operations manager. Julia was efficient, dedicated and gifted. She loved the job and had begun overseeing the company's day&#x2013;to&#x2013;day activities, freeing Bethanne to focus on creative development. Annie worked with her, and the two of them had recently developed birthday party ideas for cats and dogs, which was now a popular trend, especially among childless, affluent professionals. They'd expanded into other types of parties, too&#x2014;anniversary and retirement celebrations, Christmas and even Halloween events.</p> <p>Bethanne signaled for the check, and they went their separate ways with a quick hug and a wave. Annie was walking back to the office, while Bethanne headed for Blossom Street and A Good Yarn. Knitting had become one of her favourite activities. When</p> <p>she needed to think, nothing helped more than sitting down with a knitting project. She felt a sense of happy anticipation as she parked in front of the yarn store, which was owned by her dear friend Lydia Goetz.</p> <p>With the wedding only six weeks away, she'd wanted to knit something for Courtney, her almost-daughter-in-law, to wear during the wedding.</p> <p><em>The wedding</em>. It was why Grant had called her two weeks ago&#x2014; their son's marriage had given him a legitimate excuse&#x2014;and he'd called twice since then, including this morning.</p> <p>Other than the occasional joint decisions they'd made regarding their children, they'd had little personal contact since the divorce. Then Grant had phoned her with a question about a wedding gift for Andrew and Courtney. He'd been friendly and relaxed. And this week, he'd asked her to dinner.</p> <p>Dinner. She and Grant. After six years?</p> <p>She'd heard from Annie that his marriage to Tiffany had ended in divorce the previous year&#x2014;after a brief separation&#x2014;and felt genuinely sorry for him. This was a second divorce for Tiffany, as well. In fact, Bethanne had briefly dated Paul, Tiffany's first husband, shortly after the divorce, although <em>date</em> wasn't exactly the right word. They'd been more of a two-person support group, helping each other grapple with their betrayal by the people they loved. Unfortunately, Andrew's relationship with his father remained cool. Her son had met his father's desertion with a bitter resolve that only seemed to harden as he grew older. Andrew was polite but kept an emotional distance from Grant.</p> <p>For Annie, sixteen at the time, the divorce had been nothing short of devastating. Always a "daddy's girl," she'd acted out her shock and pain as only a willful teenager can. Annie blamed Tiffany for stealing her father away and had done everything she could to sabotage the marriage. But Bethanne was also a target for her rage during those early months. Annie had railed at her for being too "boring" and "clueless" to keep her father happy. Bethanne had never responded to Annie's accusations about her failures as a wife, afraid to reveal how close to home her words had hit. Eventually, Annie had adjusted to the new reality, although she still referred to Grant's second wife in sarcastic tones as "the <em>lovely</em> Tiffany."</p> <p>Bethanne thought about her conversation with him that morning. His excuse for calling this time was so flimsy Bethanne couldn't even remember what it was. He'd kept her on the line, relating office gossip as if she was still intimately familiar with the goings-on at his workplace. After several minutes of chatter, he reminded her that she hadn't given him a definite answer regarding his dinner invitation.</p> <p>"Grant," she'd said bluntly. "Why are you doing this?"</p> <p>For a moment there was silence on the other end. When he spoke, any hints of lightheartedness were gone. "I made a mistake, Bethanne." His voice caught, and for once he seemed at a loss for words. "A major one." He left the rest unsaid, but she knew what he meant. He wanted things back the way they used to be.</p> <p>Well, good luck with that. Bethanne wasn't the same naive woman he'd divorced, and she wasn't interested in retracing her steps.</p> <p>After six years on her own, she'd discovered she didn't want or need a man complicating her life. Years ago she'd read somewhere that "it takes a hell of a man to replace no man." At first, that remark had seemed merely humorous; she hadn't completely understood what it meant. She did now.</p> <p>While she was flattered that Grant wanted to reconcile, the situation wasn't that simple. He'd had his chance. <em>He</em> was the one who'd deserted <em>her,</em> who'd left her floundering and shaken. Without ever thinking about the consequences of his actions, he'd ripped apart their family, betrayed her and their children, robbed them all of their security.</p> <p>Now he was sorry. Fine. He'd seen the error of his ways and realized what a terrible mistake he'd made.</p> <p>So of course he wanted her back. She was a successful businesswoman with a growing company that received lots of media and corporate interest. In six short years she'd made a name for herself. She'd been interviewed by <em>Forbes</em> and the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. A piece had been written about her in <em>USA Today</em>. Her ex had his nerve.</p> <p>Contrition was all well and good. Bethanne felt a certain vindication in hearing Grant admit how wrong he'd been, a certain sense of righteousness. She'd forgiven him to the best of her ability, refusing to let herself be trapped in the mire of resentment. He had a new life and so did she. But forgiveness, she'd learned, was tricky. Just when she felt sure she was beyond rancor, she'd find herself wallowing in indignation. Like the night three years ago when the pipe burst in the basement and she couldn't figure out where to turn off the water. If Grant had been there he would've known what to do. By the time she found the tap she'd been shaking with anger, and as unreasonable as it seemed, she'd blamed Grant. This was all <em>his</em> fault. He should've been there. How dared he do this to her and, worse, to their children!</p> <p>She should reject his invitation, she told herself now. Laugh in his face. Tell him to take a hike.</p> <p>To her astonishment she couldn't.</p> <p>It had taken courage for Grant to approach her, courage and, yes, nerve. She'd give him that. Crazy though it might be, Bethanne realized she still had feelings for Grant, feelings she'd pushed aside for the past few years. She didn't love him, not in the all-consuming way she had when they were married. Back then, she'd been blind to his flaws and his weaknesses, blind to what should've been obvious, especially after he'd started the affair. His betrayal had revealed that the man she'd married was selfish and shallow. And yet he hadn't <em>always</em> been like that. She couldn't forget the companionship&#x2014;and the passion&#x2014;of their early years together....</p> <p>She loved him.</p> <p>She hated him.</p> <p>Both emotions warred within her.</p> <p>"Dinner for old times' sake," he'd almost pleaded. "Besides, we need to talk about Andrew's wedding."</p> <p>Six years ago Bethanne had been desperate for him to come home. Her pride was gone. What she'd craved was exactly what Grant wanted now&#x2014;for everything to go back to the way it had been. At the time she'd believed she could fix whatever was wrong. They'd been happy, and could be again.</p> <p>When it became apparent that his affair with Tiffany wasn't a fling and Grant fully intended to go through with the divorce, an all-consuming rage had taken root. She couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. At night she lay awake plotting revenge. One day Grant would be sorry. He'd beg her to take him back and she'd laugh in his face. He would pay for what he'd done.</p> <p>Then, several months after the divorce was finalized, she woke with that familiar ugly feeling in the pit of her stomach and realized this corrosive, soul-destroying bitterness couldn't continue. As the saying had it, the best revenge was living well&#x2014;living a successful, independent life. So Bethanne had dedicated herself to her business.</p> <p>Gradually, she'd stopped thinking about Grant. She embraced her new life, her new identity. Indirectly, she had Grant to thank for her flourishing business, her circle of loyal new friends, for the strength and confidence she'd never known she had. It felt odd to her now that she'd once been content to be simply Grant's wife, looking after his social affairs and staying in the background.</p> <p>Dinner for old times' sake? Just the two of them?</p> <p>In the years since the divorce, Bethanne had dated a number of men. Besides Tiffany's ex, a couple of them stood out in her mind. But she'd been so focused on building her business that neither relationship had lasted more than six months. She wasn't ready or willing to make a serious commitment to anyone. Those relationships, albeit short, had boosted her depleted ego. She'd enjoyed them but she wasn't looking for a long-term commitment.</p> <p>Bethanne had concluded their phone call without giving Grant an answer. She needed to ponder her ex-husband's newfound contrition, and there was no more effective way of doing that than knitting. It was both productive and contemplative; you created something while you meditated on your problems. That was why she'd stopped at Lydia's&#x2014;to pick up yarn for the elegant fingerless gloves she'd make for Courtney's wedding.</p> <p>Lydia glanced up from the display she was working on and smiled when Bethanne entered the store. "You got my message! The cashmere yarn's in."</p> <p>Bethanne smiled back. "I can hardly wait to get started." Knitting had seen her through the darkest days of her life. Annie was the one who'd signed her up for classes, because even dialing the phone number for the yarn store was more than she could manage back then; the smallest tasks had seemed insurmountable. In retrospect, Bethanne knew she'd fallen into a dangerous depression.</p> <p>Annie had enrolled Bethanne in a beginners' sock-knitting class. Meeting the other women had been a turning point for her. Her new friends gave her courage and the determination to emerge from her ordeal a stronger woman. Not only that, it was through the knitting class that she'd met Elise, and through Elise, Maverick. He'd ended up being the "angel" who'd helped her launch Parties. Her classmates had reminded Bethanne that she wasn't alone, rebuilding her confidence one stitch at a time.</p> <p>That class was the beginning of Bethanne's new life. And Part Two turned out to be better than Part One had ever been. Was it possible to knit the two halves together again? Did she want to?</p> <p>"The pattern isn't difficult," Lydia told her as she brought the yarn to the cash register. "Once you do a couple of repeats, I'm sure you won't have a problem, but if you do, just stop by and I'll help you figure it out."</p> <p>Bethanne paid for the purchase, grateful that Lydia had wound the yarn, saving her the effo...</p></p><h2>In the Light of the Moon: Thirteen Lunar Tales from Around the World Illuminating Life&#39;s Mysteries</h2><p>Throughout the year, as it moves inexorably through its phases, the moon is a source of wonder, inspiration, and knowledge for countless sky watchers.

He was brave; he was holy; he adventured in distant lands; he had marvelous eyes; and he died a martyr's death at Khartoum in the Sudan in 1884 when the English garrison was overrun by the Moslem fanatics of the Mahdi.<br><br>But if Gordon was flawless as a legend, those closer to him knew a different side of his personality. Gladstone, who in public referred to Gordon as a hero of heroes, was privately infuriated by his eccentricities and independence. He was a chain smoker, a heavy drinker, and ever since Lytton Strachey's shocking, debunking portrait in EMINENT VICTORIANS, the hint of homosexuality has been attached to Gordon's name. Whereas Gordon once seemed a plaster saint, he appears to us now as something of a maverick. The unflinching courage might today be called neurosis, and even his simple, fundamentalist Christianity now seems to have its darker side.<br><br>In constructing this full-length, splendidly researched portrait of a many faceted man, Charles Chenevix Trench confronts the central fact of Gordon's career and personality: the unaccountable fascination which he exercised over others. Time and again in these pages we meet men who were willing to uproot their lives and endure appalling hardships, just to follow Gordon: to China, to South Africa, to Khartoum. It was an extraordinary power, and simply by exerting it, Gordon, like T. E. Lawrence, influenced the course of world history.</p><p></p><h2>The Unlimited Dream Company</h2><p><p>From the author of the Sunday Times bestseller Cocaine Nights comes an acclaimed backlist title - in which suburban London is transformed into an exotic dreamworld - now reissued in new cover style.When a light aircraft crashes into the Thames at Shepperton, the young pilot who struggles to the surface minutes later seems to have come back from the dead.

You can probably think back to a moment in life where you avoided it, suppressed it, or hid it. If your experience is anything like mine, I know that none of these reactions helped you achieve anything. Instead, you found yourself further away from what you wanted to accomplish and more frustrated than ever before.<br> &nbsp;<br> But you don&#x2019;t have to keep running from fear. In fact, there&#x2019;s a way to overcome and eradicate each and every fear you face. Let me introduce you to the five-step bravery process I have created to help people fight the ten biggest fears we all face. The diagram below outlines its specific steps&#x2014;or stages&#x2014;which everyone moves through in their quest to unlock an extraordinary life: complacency, inspiration, fear, passion, and bravery.<br> &nbsp;<br> Note that you start off at a low and flat point of complacency or the &#x201c;playing it safe&#x201d; stage, before an inspiration or idea strikes that spurs you to want to make a positive change. Often this is also the point at which one or many of the common fears we&#x2019;ll explore in this book sets in. You may find yourself asking questions like &#x201c;What if I fail or am rejected?&#x201d; &#x201c;What if I&#x2019;m not up to the challenge?&#x201d; &#x201c;What if it&#x2019;s the wrong decision or it ends up hurting my future or those around me?&#x201d; These or unexpected obstacles can easily send you back into the valley of doubt and fear. But as I will show you in each chapter, you can harness the power of your passion and drive to overcome any fears or mental blocks that are stalling your progress toward achieving your dream. And eventually that leads to the final step of the process, bravery, where you emerge stronger and more courageous and confident than before. In undergoing this journey, you eventually move to a higher and much happier point in your life and toward the bravest version of yourself.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s important to point out as well that I&#x2019;ve placed the five stages of the process in this order because it is the order in which most people whom I have worked with as a successful business consultant and life coach&#x2014;and many I interviewed for this book&#x2014;have experienced them. I underwent them in this order as well. However, you may find that you go through them in a different sequence, perhaps with an idea or inspiration sparking your bravery process and then fear or complacency settling in until something kindles your passion and drives you to take the leap to achieve your goal. The order in which you undergo the stages doesn&#x2019;t matter as long as you keep moving toward the end goal, which is developing the courage to pursue what you want and live the life you&#x2019;ve dreamed of. Along the way, you will be reminded of why you started climbing in the first place, and you will be forced to make the most important decision of your life, possibly more than once: choosing whether to give in to fear or fight it and climb onward toward bravery.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book will help you power through your own bravery journey, so the critical first step is to identify where you currently are in the process. Let&#x2019;s start by exploring complacency, and then we&#x2019;ll move to finding ideas that are big enough to pursue and passion for them that is strong enough to carry you through to bravery.<br> &nbsp;<br> Complacency (the &#x201c;Playing It Safe&#x201d; Stage)<br> &nbsp;<br> If you know anything about car racing, or sports for that matter, then you have probably heard of NASCAR driving legend Richard Petty. Many people remember him for his Charlie 1 Horse cowboy hat and trademark sunglasses, but he&#x2019;s best known for winning the Daytona 500 seven times. Something happened in the 1970s that sent his winning streak into a tailspin, though. His opponents changed with the times and updated their cars, but instead of doing the same, Petty was complacent. When asked how things changed so drastically, he answered: &#x201c;We&#x2019;d been winning steadily for twenty years and decided we wouldn&#x2019;t change.&#x201d; Petty played it safe, and as a result he didn&#x2019;t have one win in the last eight years of his career. Not one.<br> &nbsp;<br> Complacency and/or &#x201c;playing it safe&#x201d; are silent enemies that can tell us all the reasons why we don&#x2019;t need to keep pressing forward and become better. This concept doesn&#x2019;t just apply to sports&#x2014;it can stall any aspect of life or business. As I mentioned earlier, I played it safe for such a long time that once I got an idea, I never looked back, but for many, the idea comes first in the bravery process, and complacency follows suit. Again, keep an eye out for this during your bravery journey.<br> &nbsp;<br> If the word &#x201c;complacent&#x201d; comes to mind when you think about yourself, then you need to begin by asking yourself this two-point question: &#x201c;How much is living a great life worth to me, and can I afford to not become better?&#x201d; Your answers will give you your much-needed reason to begin moving away from complacency and toward bravery right now.<br> &nbsp;<br> So what does &#x201c;playing it safe&#x201d; or &#x201c;being complacent&#x201d; look like? One way that people play it safe is by using their full schedules as a reason for why they aren&#x2019;t pursuing more of their life&#x2019;s dreams. As life becomes busy, we become attuned to the rhythm of monotony, and the easy thing to do is to let time get away from us. Chances are that a lack of time is the reason you fall back into this false sense of security and aren&#x2019;t adding more value to the world around you. This is why you will see many ideas around the subject of time in this book&#x2014;our fears and our amount of available time are related in many instances. I get it. You are busy. But maybe your busy life is your crutch: you keep saying yes to things that don&#x2019;t matter, and that is what keeps you in the safe zone.<br> &nbsp;<br> The problem is, life just keeps getting busier, and our crazy schedules will keep us stuck in a boring, safe routine. &#x201c;Oh, my boss wants me to work such long hours that I only get four hours of sleep a night and barely see my family.&#x201d; Sure, gotta become a workaholic to make money and get it all done&#x2014;right? Maybe you know what I&#x2019;m talking about. If we&#x2019;re not careful, other people, or outside forces with their own agendas, will recruit us as their puppets. When we find ourselves letting everyone else dictate what we do and how we use our lives, we miss out on vital opportunities to succeed, grow, and feel fulfilled, ultimately leading to complacency. I know you don&#x2019;t want to give busyness the upper hand and bury the chance of moving forward with the life you want, and the good news is that you don&#x2019;t have to.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s time to take back your life. Fix your schedule to create space. This much-needed time is what will get you to the next stage: ideas. I don&#x2019;t want you to find this space only for the sake of clearing out the mental clutter that bogs us all down. I want you to find more time before you begin moving, to allow you to tinker with ideas in the next stage. Having time not only allows you to think about what is ahead, but also frees you up long enough to really engage with your thoughts, put them under the microscope, and then test them out.<br> &nbsp;<br> If you&#x2019;re having a problem with thinking of new ideas, your issue is probably not a lack of imagination; busyness is what&#x2019;s keeping you rushed and clouding your mind. Without rest, meditation, and free thinking, you will continue using the crutch of playing it &#x201c;busy&#x201d; and safe for far too long. Learning to fight busyness should be your number one priority. How do you do this? By focusing on what you want and need to accomplish.<br> &nbsp;<br> When you know what your top priorities are, you don&#x2019;t have to wonder what needs less attention, because you have already streamlined your life to focus on what matters most to you. Prioritizing brings clarity and direction. When you take on anything and everything, life quickly becomes chaotic. You can&#x2019;t possibly do everything and still do it well. But when you decide what you need to pour your heart into, you allow yourself to be more creative in those areas and can make a bigger impact with your life&#x2019;s work.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Now, grab a notebook and take ten minutes to write down your current priorities before you begin this journey. You will need this notebook for later exercises as well so keep it close by. (If you already know your priorities, use this prompt as a reminder.) Now that you&#x2019;re finished writing your priorities down, take a look at your findings. Are you happy or unhappy with your results? If you&#x2019;re unhappy with your priorities, the good news is that you can now make changes as you see fit.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> But don&#x2019;t wait to remove what doesn&#x2019;t move you toward your goals. Make a phone call if you need to make a phone call to free up more time. Send an e-mail if you need to send an e-mail. Schedule a meeting if you need to schedule a meeting. Whomever you need to talk to and whatever you need to do to create more time in your day, do it right now. This book is pointless unless you take action to improve your life. Place a bookmark here and continue reading once you eliminate the unnecessary.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now that you have your focused priorities, you can add more things back into your schedule. But as you add these commitments back in, you will now be more aware of your unique purpose. This step is so important because when you take the time to tweak your life to hold only what is near and dear to your heart, you become optimistic and more effective with your efforts.<br> &nbsp;<br> Great things happen when there is time to mold our ideas into better ones, and that only happens when we give the process of finding solutions more of our time. Rushing creativity leads only to basic, surface thoughts, but when we have time to ponder our ideas, we get to push through and dig deeper to find the best possible answers to our biggest questions.<br> &nbsp;<br> Prioritizing helps us commit to what is important and lowers our unnecessary stress levels. Overwhelming stress is not helpful, but the kind of stress that moves us out of our comfort zone is not necessarily a bad thing. Stress is sometimes the little push we need to get things done, but again we need to make sure that the stress we are feeling is only being directed toward what is important enough to pursue further.<br> &nbsp;<br> As each of us figures out our priorities, it&#x2019;s important to consider the season of life we are in. Not all life seasons are the same. Some are busier and some are slower, and it is your job to be aware of the season you are in and still affect the world in the midst of it. If it is a busy time in life, then your impact probably won&#x2019;t be as big. If you find yourself with tons of freedom, though, it&#x2019;s time to get to work. As I write this, my wife and I have two young children. I own two businesses and am involved in various community projects. But if you were to ask my wife how our marriage is, she would say it is the best it has ever been. How is this? I have learned how to manage time well. But if it were the old me, I would probably have to let go of the community involvement at least. It&#x2019;s about knowing your season, seeing your limits, being realistic with your time, and prioritizing what is truly important.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I began the process of stepping out and deciding to not play life safe, did I bite off more than I could chew at some points? Did the pursuit of bravery and moving ahead sometimes cause me to commit to too many things? I have to answer yes, but it was because my focus wasn&#x2019;t on priorities. I kept agreeing to do more without looking at what was truly valuable. Again, to move from playing it safe your priorities need to be aligned to free up time so you can take on bigger and better things. And if you ever feel like you don&#x2019;t have enough time for your priorities and everything else in life, just remember the story of the mayonnaise jar and two cups of coffee.<br> &nbsp;<br> A professor stood before his philosophy class, with some items in front of him. When the class began, he picked up a very large, empty mayonnaise jar and filled it with golf balls. He then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was. The professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured it into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the golf balls. He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was, again. The professor then picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else. He asked once more if the jar was full. The students responded with a unanimous yes. The professor then pulled two cups of coffee from under the table and poured their entire contents into the jar, effectively filling the empty space between the grains of sand. The students laughed. &#x201c;Now,&#x201d; said the professor, as the laughter subsided, &#x201c;I want you to recognize that this jarred presents your life. The golf balls are the important things&#x2014;your passions. Things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full. The pebbles are the things that matter, like your job, house, and car. The sand is everything else&#x2014;the small stuff,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If you put the sand into the jar first,&#x201d; he continued, &#x201c;There is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls. The same goes for life. If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you. So pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Take care of the golf balls first&#x2014;the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand.&#x201d; One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the coffee represented. The professor smiled and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you asked. It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem, there&#x2019;s always room for a couple of cups of coffee with a friend.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>Ordering Your Private World - Man in the Mirror Edition - includes Study Guide</h2><p>Ingram - In today&#39;s busy world, it is increasingly difficult to discover the inner peace and order that bring an outward sense of stability and joy.

Richard Lynn's introduction to this new translation explains the organization of <i>The Classic of Changes</i> through the history of its various parts, and describes how the text was and still is used as a manual of divination with both the stalk and coin methods.The first new translation of this work to appear in more than twenty-five years, the Columbia I Ching presents the classic book of changes for the world of today. Used in China as a book of divination and source of wisdom for more than three thousand years by scholars and general readers alike, it has influenced Western intellectuals and artists from Carl Jung to John Cage, bringing this most important work of the Confucian canon immense popular appeal. Finally, after decades of inaccurate translations and outdated, expurgated pocket editions, here is an I Ching that catches up with its readers. Richard Lynn&#39;s introduction explains the organization of The Classic of Changes through the history of its various parts, and describes how the text was and is still used as a manual of divination with both the stalk and coin methods. For the fortune-telling initiate, he provides a chart of trigrams and hexagrams; an index of terms, names, and concepts; a glossary and bibliography; and thoughts on his method of translation. Lynn presents for the first time in English the fascinating commentary of Wang Bi (226-249), who was the principal definer of the work for some seven hundred years. Wang Bi interpreted the I Ching as a book of moral and political wisdom, arguing that the text should not be read literally, but rather as an expression of abstract ideas. Lynn places Wang Bi&#39;s commentary in historical context and examines the interpretation of this common source for both Confucian and Taoist philosophy before and after Wang Bi&#39;s time. Columbia&#39;s I Ching offers devotees the most authoritative and lucid translation they have yet to encounter, while giving first-time readers the chance to consult afascinating and important Chinese work. The Classic of Changes will be the new standard for years to come.</p><h2>Mysticism: The Nature and Development of Spiritual Consciousness</h2><p>In this classic introduction to mysticism, Underhill draws on hundreds of sources to present a unique study of the mystical experience.</p><p>LONG REGARDED AS A CLASSIC TEXT, AND written by the foremost authority on the subject, Mysticism remains the pre-eminent study of humanity's spiritual consciousness.<p>Drawing on the voices of such great mystics as Meister Eckhart, St John of the Cross, St Teresa of Avila, Rumi and 'Attar, Underhill offers a unique account of the multi-dimensional world of the mystic, from psychology and symbolism to visions and contemplation. She both introduces mysticism and examines the stages of mystical awakening that lead the human soul from a life of sense to a spiritual life in harmony with the Absolute -- however it is understood.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, Underhill shows how the mystical experience is within reach of us all, and presents an inspiring vision of what this world offers to those who choose to enter it.</p>Evelyn Underhill, a novelist and poet, published her first book in 1902 but her growing interest in mysticism led in 1911 to her greatest work. Mysticism immediately established Underhill as the leading writer in the field, and she continued her work by writing many more significant and acclaimed books and essays. In 1921 she became Upton Lecturer in the Philosophy of Religion at Manchester College, and she was the first woman to give a series of lectures on theology at Oxford.</p><h2>A Modern Approach to Basketry With Fibers and Grasses, Using Coiling, Twining, Weaving, Macrame, Crocheting</h2><p>Views basket weaving as an art form and details the use of coiling, twining, macrame, and crochet to create various containers</p><p></p><h2>The Good Times Are Killing Me</h2><p>Nationally syndicated cartoonist Lynda Barry's moving, quirky and honest first novel about a young girl's coming of age--which has also been a hit off-Broadway play--is back in print, with new artwork by the author. In <i>The Good Times Are Killing Me</i>, Lynda Barry reveals her masterful way with story, memory, and feelings, and anyone who lingers in Edna Arkins's world will be the better for it.</p><p>Readers of alternative weeklies will be familiar with Lynda Barry's work from her long-running comic strip, <i>Ernie Pook's Comeek</i>. Similarly, <i>The Good Times Are Killing Me</i> focuses on the surprisingly complex emotional world of children. It is the story of a neighborhood going through the throes of integration and white flight as seen through the eyes of young Edna Arkins. Edna forms an unlikely friendship with Bonna Willis, a girl with a talent for "ass beating." Edna is white and Bonna is black, and from the start there are pressures from both sides against their friendship.

It is a deep and rich biblical study of sanctification - how Christians grow in holiness and become more like Jesus. In a day when Christians are very prone to pursue self-help methods to grow in obedience to Christ, Walter Marshall lays out the biblical way of growth: obedience comes as Christians live by grace, in union with Christ, by faith. Growth comes, as Paul says in Galatians 2:20, through &#34;Christ living in me.&#34; The message of this book is so important for Christians today, it is essential that it be rewritten in contemporary English.</p><p>Dr. Bruce H.

The word "dharma" means a way of living that upholds the path of evolution, maintains balance, and supports both prosperity and spiritual freedom. <br><br>For the first time, we can understand why one child learns quickly and forgets quickly while another learns slowly and forgets slowly; why one child is hyperactive and another slow moving; or why one falls asleep quickly but wakes in the night while another takes hours to fall asleep. <br><br>Leading brain researchers Robert Keith Wallace and Frederick Travis combine knowledge from modern science, ancient Ayurveda, and their personal experience to show how to unfold the full potential of a child's brain, as well as how to nurture his or her inherent brilliance and goodness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The first tool of <i>Dharma Parenting</i> is to determine your child's--and your own--brain/body type through a simple quiz. The Eastern system of natural medicine called Ayurveda has used three distinct mind/body types (and combinations of these types) for thousands of years. Scientific studies suggest that there is a specific set of genetic, biochemical, and physiological characteristics that underlie each of the three main Ayurveda mind/body types. <br><br>Coupling old and new wisdom, <i>Dharma Parenting</i> offers unique insight into why a child is the way he or she is and reveals how to bring each child into a state of balance. Its language is readily comprehensible by parents of any cultural background, with real-life stories to illustrate areas of universal parental concern--such as emotions, behavior, language, learning styles, habits, diet, health issues, and, most importantly, the parent-child relationship.</p><p>ROBERT KEITH WALLACE is a pioneering researcher on the physiology of consciousness. His research has inspsired hundreds of studies on the benefits of meditation and other mind-body techniques. Dr. Wallace's findings have been published in Science, American Journal of Physiology, and Scientific American. He received his BS in physics and his PhD in physiology from UCLA and conducted postgraduate research at Harvard University. Dr. Wallace is the founding president of Maharishi University of Management (MUM) in Fairfield, Iowa. <br><br>FREDERICK TRAVIS is a world-renowned neuroscientist who has discovered brain wave patterns in children and young people that correlate with&nbsp; greater moral reasoning, happiness, emotional stability, and academic performance. Dr. Travis has authored or coauthored 70 scientific papers, many published in leading peer-reviewed journals. Dr. Travis received his masters and PhD in psychology from Maharishi University of Management (MUM). After a two-year post-doctoral position at University of California at Davis, he returned to MUM to direct the EEG, Consciousness, and Cognition Lab.<b>DHARMA PARENTING</b> is a unique approach to raising happy and successful children. It starts with the understanding that kids are people with their own strengths and weakness, their own gifts and preferences. Dharma Parenting provides you with simple tools to help your children discover <i>who they are and what they can become</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dharma is a concept found in Eastern traditions. The word &#x201c;dharma&#x201d; comes from the Sanskrit verb <i>dhri</i>, which means to &#x201c;uphold&#x201d; or &#x201c;support.&#x201d; Our dharma is our path in life&#x2014;the lifestyle that supports our personal growth, happiness, success, and fulfillment. Dharma is different at different ages, and for different children. One child learns quickly and forgets quickly, while another learns slowly and forgets slowly. One may be content to work alone for long periods of time; another wants to be surrounded by friends. If we are lucky, we find our dharma early in life. <br> &nbsp;<br> For example, we know a brilliant second-year college student who wants to teach high school math. He feels that he was born to be a teacher&#x2014;his parents were both teachers, and he has been tutoring classmates since third grade. He tells us there&#x2019;s nothing as satisfying as his friends&#x2019; &#x201c;Aha!&#x201d; when they finally &#x201c;get&#x201d; what he&#x2019;s trying to teach them. It&#x2019;s clear that teaching is his dharma. Two of his college professors, however, were shocked when he revealed his career goal. One responded by telling him to get a PhD: &#x201c;You could do brilliant theoretical work!&#x201d; And his computer science teacher said, &#x201c;You could become a world-class programmer and be a millionaire before you&#x2019;re twenty-five!&#x201d; Both of these professors were projecting their own talents and desires onto the student, instead of encouraging his special aptitudes and interest. Rather than help him find his own path, they wanted him to travel down theirs. The tools of Dharma Parenting allow us to recognize and nurture our children&#x2019;s unique path in life: what they&#x2019;re good at, what they enjoy, what helps them grow. In addition, these tools help us understand each of the stages of brain development, from birth to adulthood, so our parenting takes into account our children&#x2019;s developmental level&#x2014;not demanding things that they cannot yet accomplish, but always gently encouraging them to use more of their potential.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dharma Parenting tools help us find our own dharma as a parent. Did you ever wish that babies came with manuals? It&#x2019;s so much easier to use a new gadget when there&#x2019;s an instruction manual! Parenting is tremendously complex and often hopelessly confusing. Understanding the principles of brain/body types and the stages of brain development will empower you to apply Dharma Parenting tools in a variety of changing situations. In other words, you will be able to begin to fulfill your dharma as a parent.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>INTRODUCTION TO DHARMA PARENTING </b>3<br> Dharma Parenting incorporates six parenting tools that apply to children of all age groups. They&#x2019;re easy to remember using the word &#x201c;dharma&#x201d; as an acronym: <br> &nbsp;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>D</b>iscover your child&#x2019;s, and your own, brain/body type<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>H</b>eal yourself<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A</b>ttention and appreciation<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>R</b>outines to improve family dynamics<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>M</b>anage meltdowns and cultivate better behavior<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A</b>nticipate and adapt<br> &nbsp;<br> Let&#x2019;s see how these tools might be applied in a specific situation.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Six-year-old Ryan storms into the kitchen, his blue eyes welling with tears, cheeks flaming red, as he flings his game box onto the floor, cracking its screen.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>&#x201c;This game is stupid. I hate it!&#x201d; the boy screams, and runs out of the room, leaving his mother shaken. What can I do? she wonders. How do I handle his rage?</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> Ryan is a bright, energetic child who can be perfectly agreeable and normal for days, until some small thing throws him into a violent tantrum. Lately, both of Ryan&#x2019;s parents have noticed his growing tendency to overreact, almost to <i>overheat</i>&#x2014;mentally, physically, and emotionally&#x2014;and they are increasingly concerned. What&#x2019;s causing this alarming behavior? What is the cure? Is it time to find a child psychologist? Is it just a case of &#x201c;boys will be boys&#x201d;? Does he need medication?<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>THE FIRST TOOL&#x2014;D: DISCOVER YOUR CHILD&#x2019;S, AND YOUR OWN, BRAIN/BODY TYPE</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Your brain/body type includes (1) your inherited tendencies and preferences that have been hardwired from birth, also known as our &#x201c;body type,&#x201d; (2) the state of balance or imbalance of your body type, and (3) your changing brain connections, which are constantly being shaped by ongoing experiences as well the stage of your brain development. Ryan appears to be a particular brain/body type that is susceptible to anger. Also, Ryan is six years old. His brain is wired to be a sensory-motor machine that sees the world very concretely. If a video machine doesn&#x2019;t work, it should be thrown out. So when his game box stopped working, he became upset and threw it away because of the <i>state </i>of his brain/body type as well as his age-related brain connections. <br> &nbsp;<br> One brain/body type responds with impatience and anger. Another might respond with nervousness and fear. A third type might not respond at all. The combination of inherent tendencies and personal brain development determines how everyone responds. <br> &nbsp;<br> In chapter 1 you will learn about the basic characteristics of each type and you can take a short quiz to help you figure out your child&#x2019;s brain/body type, as well as your own and the rest of your family&#x2019;s. In chapter 2, we will discuss interactions between family members with different brain/body types. In the last section of this chapter, we&#x2019;ll explore in greater detail how the brain changes during the first two decades of life and how these changes shape behavior. <br> &nbsp;<br><b>THE SECOND TOOL&#x2014;H: HEAL YOURSELF</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> If you are tired or stressed, you might well respond very much like Ryan&#x2019;s mother did. She started to yell&#x2014;after all, it was an expensive video game. But once you and your child begin to yell, the situation explodes into chaos and nothing gets resolved.<br> &nbsp;<br> We understand that you&#x2019;re a parent 24-7, and with all the demands of raising kids, there may not seem to be time for healing yourself. But you&#x2019;ve got to remain aware of your own needs&#x2014;for your children&#x2019;s sake as well as your own.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>THE THIRD TOOL&#x2014;A: ATTENTION AND APPRECIATION</b><br> &nbsp;<br> If Ryan&#x2019;s mom or dad had sat down with him and helped him better understand how to play the game, and if they had congratulated him on how well he was doing <i>before </i>he became so frustrated, his blowup might have been avoided. Childhood is a roller-coaster ride of growth and development, propelled by massive transformations in the child&#x2019;s brain connections. Parental attention during these years is critical for your child to learn how to work in groups and develop self-esteem, social skills, a sense of right and wrong, respect for others, and even critical and creative thinking.<br> &nbsp;<br> Your attention is immensely important. Children are not static objects; they are constantly growing in response to each new experience. By appreciating each new accomplishment, you are supporting their developing sense of self and ability to interact with the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>THE FOURTH TOOL&#x2014;R: ROUTINES TO IMPROVE FAMILY DYNAMICS</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Established routines&#x2014;bedtime routines, dining room routines, or shopping routines&#x2014;give children a sense of security. They know what is expected of them in each situation. Routines break up a long day into meaningful chunks and give your child a feeling of being in control.<br> &nbsp;<br> Another valuable routine is family meetings&#x2014;a designated time to talk about issues in a calm and supportive setting. This would be an ideal setting for Ryan&#x2019;s parents to help him figure out what to do when his toys don&#x2019;t work: for example, put them on a special shelf, tell Mom or Dad what&#x2019;s wrong with them, and then play Mr. Fix-It together.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>THE FIFTH TOOL&#x2014;M: MANAGE MELTDOWNS AND CULTIVATE BETTER BEHAVIOR</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> This tool consists of six recommendations, all starting with the letter C.<br> &nbsp;<br> 1. Check in with yourself and with your child<br> 2. Comfort your child<br> 3. Change brain states<br> 4. Choices<br> 5. Consequences<br> 6. Coach<br> &nbsp;<br> Let&#x2019;s apply these six C&#x2019;s to Ryan&#x2019;s situation:<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Check in with yourself and with your child. </b>Ryan&#x2019;s parents first need to determine their own brain states. For example: Are their emotions on edge? Did they skip lunch and are now famished and irritated? <br> &nbsp;<br> Next, they need to check in with their son. Was the video game too difficult for him? Was he overheated or hungry or both? Is he having problems at school? Is he sleeping badly? Ryan is six years old; this means that the prefrontal &#x201c;executive&#x201d; circuits of his brain have not developed yet. At this age, he can&#x2019;t even begin to comprehend such adult abstractions as &#x201c;Do you know how much that game costs?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Comfort your child.</b> Your child knows that something is wrong. The thinking centers of his brain are overwhelmed with strong emotions. A long, warm hug or just a touch on the shoulder reassures him that everything is going to be okay. Comforting your child is the basis for your success in following the C&#x2019;s. It lets him know that some part of his world is loving and supportive, no matter how badly he&#x2019;s feeling.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Change the brain state. </b>The first thing Ryan needs is to cool down his overheated brain. When your child overreacts, it is because the primitive emotional brain has taken over. Reason is simply not available at that moment. Strong passionate emotions dominate, and the child can only respond impulsively. Ryan needs help so he can switch from being dominated by his irrational, emotional brain to being able to use his reflective, thinking brain. Even moving to another part of the house can help him begin to settle down. We will talk more about meltdowns and temper tantrums in chapter 6.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Choices.</b> Once Ryan is calm, his mom and dad can offer him concrete choices&#x2014;for example, &#x201c;The next time your game doesn&#x2019;t work, bring it to one of us so we can fix it.&#x201d; By helping Ryan reflect on his actions, his parents are showing him how to deal with frustration in the future and allowing him to exercise his executive brain circuits so they will be more available.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Consequences. </b>Ryan needs to be held accountable for his actions. His tantrum had a natural consequence: he broke his game box, so he can no longer play with it. At the family meeting, Ryan and his parents can now discuss how he can earn a new one. <br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Coach. </b>As a parent, you are your child&#x2019;s life coach. What do coaches do? In sports, they ensure that their athletes <i>train before the game </i>so they will be successful in competition. The coach watches the play and will take players out of the game if they&#x2019;re becoming overheated or emotional. Coaches teach fair play and good values. They sum up each experience so the players gain positive insight into future situations. <br> &nbsp;<br> As coaches, we model correct behavior. Neurons in the brain called &#x201c;mirror neurons&#x201d; help children model what they see. Show your child how you might deal with the situation. If he makes a mistake, help him figure out how to fix it and how to avoid it next time.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>THE SIXTH TOOL&#x2014;A: ANTICIPATE AND ADAPT</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Whether you&#x2019;re focused on nurturing your child&#x2019;s talents or working to ensure that family life moves smoothly through the day, part of your dharma as a parent is to anticipate your family&#x2019;s needs. Once you are familiar with the first five Dharma Parenting tools, you will naturally find yourself looking ahead to see how you can use those tools to avoid crises. Even so, despite your best efforts, unexpected situations will come up. You will need to adapt to the situation, using your best judgment.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>DHARMA PARENTING TOOLS ARE DIFFERENT WHEN APPLIED TO DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Throughout the first twenty-five years of life, your child&#x2019;s brain is a work in progress. With each change in brain structure and function, he begins to see the world more globally, gets better at controlling impulses, begins to see consequences, and grows in understanding abstract ideas. Dharma Parenting tools, therefore, have different characters in the four major stages of brain development. We systematically discuss the relationship between brain development and Dharma Parenting tools in the last four chapters.<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>FROM BIRTH TO THREE YEARS</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Children are born with their brain unassembled. At birth, the infant does not see you or hear your soothing words&#x2014;your baby sees and hears only disconnected bursts of light and sound. Within the first three years, brain connections grow exponentially and children grow in the ability to interact with the world. By six months of age, the visual system develops and the child sees objects in the world around them. By two years, the hearing system develops and the child connects individual sounds into the flow of speech. During this time, Dharma Parenting tools support the developing brain and help your child begin to interact with the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>FROM FOUR TO NINE YEARS</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Four to nine are the school years. During this time, your child has the highest number of connections between brain cells that he will ever have. Also, the left and right hemispheres of the brain are being connected. This is the time when the child learns how to work in groups, how to take turns, and how to follow rules. It&#x2019;s also the time of creative play&#x2014;the child&#x2019;s imagination transforms any object into many possibilities. At this age, Dharma Parenting tools support the child&#x2019;s increasing ability to think and reflect on the world. Now you can include the child when structuring guidelines and discussing rules of family life.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>FROM TEN TO SEVENTEEN YEARS</b><br> &nbsp;<br> During the preteen and teenage years, 2 percent of all braincell connections drop off each year in a natural &#x201c;pruning&#x201d; that follows a &#x201c;use it or lose it&#x201d; rule. So many changes are happening so quickly that the brain your teenager wakes up with in the morning is not the same brain he went to sleep with the night before. The teen years are also a time when fatty layers begin to be added to the prefrontal executive circuits. This results in a speeding up of the flow of information in brain areas responsible for long-term planning and ethical decision making. The teenager is now beginning to think more abstractly. Rules are no longer absolute but have different meaning in different contexts. At this age, Dharma Parenting tools help your teen make the transition from being a child to a young adult.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>FROM EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY-FIVE YEARS</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Eighteen to twenty-five are the young adult years.

Prior to becoming a writer, he worked in a factory, painted houses, and programmed computers. His hobbies include astronomy, meditating, running, playing with his nieces and nephews, and making sure his books are prominently displayed in local bookstores. He is the author of <i>Last Act, Spellbound, Gimme a Kiss, Remember Me, Scavenger Hunt, Final Friends</i> 1, 2, and 3, <i>Fall into Darkness, See You Later, Witch, Die Softly, Bury Me Deep, Whisper of Death, Chain Letter 2: The Ancient Evil, Master of Murder, Monster, Road to Nowhere, The Eternal Enemy, The Immortal,</i> and <i>The Wicked Heart,</i> all available from Archway Paperbacks. <i>Slumber Party, Weekend, Chain Letter,</i> and <i>Sati</i> -- an adult novel about a very unusual lady -- are also by Mr. Pike.<p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> The mind of a killer is an empty thing. </p><p> The strings of a puppet are filled with mischief. </p><p> Imagine a mind, then, that when a string is pulled somebody will die -- an innocent asleep in her bed. Imagine and then quickly forget, lest the impulse pluck deep and make you realize that we are all puppets in a show without rules. </p><p> But maybe that is not true. </p><p> It doesn't matter. It seems true. </p><p> Dusty Shame did not play by any rules. He had killed twice in his life and he was going to kill again. But he didn't enjoy taking human life. He wasn't a psychopath in the traditional sense of the word. He did not dream of blood and screams and feel cold sweat break out over his limbs and experience a rush of sexual satisfaction. He didn't even dislike most people, never mind hate them. No one had ever done anything particularly wrong to him, and until he started to kill, he had never thought of hurting anyone. </p><p> Yet tonight would be murder number three. </p><p> Three -- the one that was supposed to charm. </p><p> But where was the charm for poor Dusty? </p><p> Where was the reason? </p><p> The answer was so simple it couldn't be the final answer. Yet it must be put down. Dusty killed so he could rest. It was only when he forever closed the eyes of another that he could close his own eyes and sleep without the dreams and the voice telling him it was time to awaken and continue with the pain. </p><p> Of course, such a reason must have meant Dusty was crazy. People who heard voices were invariably insane, experts would say. But few experts had ever been inside a mind the equal of Dusty's. Had they entered, they would have realized that insanity was as mysterious as reason, and that the two were often difficult to separate. </p><p> Dusty may have been crazy, but he was also a nice young man. </p><p> He was eighteen years old, a senior in high school, six weeks shy of graduation. His grade point average was three point six, and he was taking chemistry, calculus, computer science, and German. He was on his way to college, that is if he didn't make a quick stop at the electric chair first. </p><p> He was a handsome young man. His hair was light brown, soft and fine like that of an angel, his eyes green as grass in evening twilight. He was five ten, fit and muscular, but plagued by repeated heartburn. He had a tendency, when in social situations, to be jerky in his movements. But when he was alone, especially when he killed, he moved smoothly and gracefully as a dancer. Always, though, he was quiet. Had he been more talkative, he certainly could have had plenty of dates. And maybe if he had spoken to more girls and listened to their voices instead of the one his head, he wouldn't have become a murderer. </p><p> Maybe, maybe not. </p><p> Dusty's first two victims had been girls. </p><p> It was late Monday night. Dusty drove through the dark California streets of his hometown, Chino -- a suburb in San Bernadino County, which adjoined both Los Angeles and Orange counties. He was headed toward his next victim's house. Years ago Chino had been a place to tie a horse in the backyard, but now there were housing developments everywhere. The town had been home for Dusty all his life. He couldn't say he liked the place, though, but that may have been because his had been a sad life. </p><p> His next victim was Nancy Bardella and she lived only two miles from him. He knew Nancy from school, unlike the other two he had killed, whom he knew only via the modem lines of a national computer network -- <i>Einstein.</i> Nancy was in his chemistry lab and class -- she sat two rows in front of him, on the right, in class. He had spoken to her a few times, although never at length. She was a pretty girl with long brown hair and dimples that showed when she laughed, which she did often. </p><p> Dusty knew from eavesdropping on her conversations that her parents were away for a few days. He had chosen to kill her, instead of another girl, largely because of this fact. Also, Nancy was a sweet girl and seldom had an unkind word to say about anybody. It was important to Dusty that each of his victims be as innocent as possible. In reality, Dusty liked Nancy. </p><p> The late April night was warm -- the month of May and another southern California summer were around the corner -- and the streets all but deserted. Dusty liked the late-night hours best, when the hum of the city was at its gentlest. He was particularly sensitive to crowds and crowd noise; it was as if the mental static of many minds wore on the, delicate centers of his brain. Often, just visiting a mall exhausted him. When he did sleep, which he seldom did, it was usually in the daytime, after school. </p><p> But he knew tonight, what was left of it, he would sleep well, if he could just kill Nancy and get rid of her body without being caught. Dusty may have loathed what he did, but he didn't want to go to jail. He felt if they locked him up, the voice would go on tormenting him endlessly, and he wouldn't be able to do anything to silence it. That was his greatest fear, although he had others. </p><p> Nancy lived at the end of a cul-de-sac in one of Chino's new housing tracts. Dusty pulled onto her street and cut the engine, allowing the car to coast into Nancy's empty driveway. He disliked bringing his car so close, but it was necessary when it came time to carry the body out. He never left a body behind, the voice was strict about that, and for that reason the parents of his first two victims were still looking for their daughters. He occasionally saw posters advertising rewards for information about their disappearances. He knew that the parents would be searching for their children for a long time. </p><p> Nancy had lived in southern California all her life. Dusty knew that her father worked as an engineer at Hughes Aircraft, and that her mother took care of preschoolers. Nancy was an only child. Her best friend was Sheila Hardholt, who was Dusty's lab partner in chemistry. Dusty liked Sheila as well. </p><p> The cul-de-sac was well lit, which bothered him. All the new housing tracts in Chino were loaded with lights. The house was also visible from many surrounding houses. If someone were to peek through a window as he was carrying out the body, he would be in serious trouble. But he knew <i>his</i> window of vulnerability was brief -- maybe a minute at best, only the actual time when he had the body in his hands. If a neighbor were to see him now, sitting in his car, it was doubtful he would sound an alarm. It would be hard to trace his car just from a glance. Red Ford Escorts were a dime a dozen in the L.A. basin. Plus he had smeared his license plate with mud. </p><p> Dusty sat in his car a moment, studying the house. There were two stories -- Nancy's bedroom was probably on the second. Although most of the houses in the neighborhood had yet to have yards installed, Nancy's parents had spent big bucks on landscaping. The lawn was made up of thick fescu grass, common to the area. Recently planted shrubs hugged the clean orange stucco walls. More important than these details were the six-foot-high walls and the accompanying gates, which would surely be locked. More than likely, he would have to take the WY out the front door, something he had not done before. </p><p> The walls presented no problem for him. He could climb over them. Sitting in the car, he decided to do just that and then try to find an open window in the back. In his pocket he carried a lock-pick kit. But he had not grown up playing with locks, and his skill at outwitting dead bolt locks was minimal at best. He also had duct tape in his pocket, and knew he could tape a window and break it without making much noise. He did that the night he had visited Stacy Domino's house, the first time he had killed. </p><p> His other tools were few: a ball peen hammer, two large heavy-duty green garbage bags, and a white towel. He used the hammer to kill; the narrow head of the ball peen hammer was a more lethal weapon than a regular hammer. The bags were for the body -- one for the top half, the other for the bottom. The towel was his special piece of paraphernalia. Just before striking the death blow, usually to the delicate temple area at the side of the skull, he would throw the towel over the girl's head. He made every effort to keep any blood from spilling, leaving the police and the parents with the idea -- the <i>possibility</i> at least -- that their daughter had merely run away or been kidnapped. But neither police nor parents would entertain the latter idea long because no ransom note would be forthcoming. </p><p> Yet these possibilities were important to satisfy the voice. They greatly heightened the torment of his acts. </p><p> On his hands he wore leather gloves. Always. </p><p> Dusty picked up the hammer, the garbage bags, and the towel, and stuffed them into a knapsack that fit over his shoulder. After turning off the overhead light, he silently opened the car door and stepped onto the concrete driveway. He closed the door, but did not shut it completely. He preferred, when he was done, to place the body in the trunk, but if he felt rushed he could set in the passenger seat. The seats, like the trunk, 'were covered with clear plastic he had obtained from a garbage bin behind a cleaners. He went to great lengths to prevent staining his car with blood. </p><p> He approached the house on the right side, opposite the porch walkway, and was over the brick wall in a moment. The backyard did not please him. Two other houses, elevated slightly above Nancy's, had unobstructed views into her yard. He had to pause to reassure himself that it was late, and that the two other houses looked as asleep as empty buildings. </p><p> A quick scan of Nancy's back windows showed him one that was half open. The sight brought him a measure of relief, although his muscles remained taunt and his breathing rapid and uneven. In his lock-pick kit was a small screwdriver. He took it out and slipped it under the bottom edge of the window screen, bending the metal slowly upward. The screen popped free. He set it on the ground and gently eased up the window. A moment later he was able to step inside with a long stretch of his legs. </p><p> He was in the living room. The furniture, glimpsed in stabs of yellow streetlight, was new, and the faint smell of fresh paint hung in the air. He stood still for several seconds and forced himself to take long deep breaths. His heartbeat was the sound of toppling stones. He had to convince himself that the beating was not reverberating off the walls, echoing up the stairs to Nancy's sleeping ears. </p><p> He started up the stairs, not even bothering to check the downstairs rooms. He <i>knew</i> Nancy was up there; he could sense her, but not with his ears or eyes. He could feel her life as clearly as he would feel that life pass through him as he brought it to an end. Her soul would pass through him, he knew, with the blow to the brain, and in that instant something inside him would sigh, and he would have peace, if only for a little while. At least it had been that way before. </p><p> It was too easy, too perfect. All three of the bedroom doors on the second floor lay open. Nancy's was the small room on the right, her soft rhythmic breathing drifting into the narrow hallway like a child's song floating on a spring breeze. Nancy, awake had always impressed Dusty as a kind person, but in sleep, even before he saw her, she touched him in a way only a saint could. She <i>was</i> innocence; he could almost hear the angels singing in her dreams. Strangely, this quality, this goodness, didn't make it harder for him to kill her, but easier. Or maybe it was not so strange because Dusty was in many ways like his nickname, <i>Dust,</i> and viewed everything from the ground level, where the insects that crawled through the mud were the best friends of the flowers that scented the air with their perfume. </p><p> Dusty moved to the open doorway and stood looking down on Nancy. She lay on her back, dressed in an oversize T-shirt, white panties, a sheet draped loosely over her tan legs. Her brown hair spread across her pillow, so perfect, like fabric woven of silk threads. Her right elbow was cocked at a sharp angle, her right hand pressed to her chin as if she were deep in thought. Her other arm hung over the side of the bed, the hand almost touching the floor, completely unafraid of the bogeyman that might lurk under the box springs. But of course she was not scared, Dusty thought, angels were watching over her. </p><p> So was something else. </p><p> As old as the angels. </p><p> Dusty removed the towel and hammer from his knapsack. </p><p> He wanted it to be quick. He didn't want her to suffer. Still, the thought of the blood plagued him, the evidence of the struggle it would leave. He had to get the towel in position without waking her. He had been able to do that with his second victim because she had been an extremely heavy sleeper. He knew that because of her loud snoring. But he did not believe Nancy would be so easy. He considered the possibilities for several seconds before coming up with a plan. </p><p> He would alter the point where he usually struck. He would not hit Nancy on the temple, but directly on the forehead. He would toss the towel over her face and strike an instant later. The first blow might not kill her -- the skull was thick in front -- but it would stun, and there would be time for others. He knew, though, even as he moved closer to the bed, that timing was critical. If he did not kill her quickly, she would scream, and both her bedroom windows were wide open. He did not want her to scream; he did not want her to know that she was about to die. </p><p> In his left hand was his towel, in his right the hammer. He stepped within a foot of the bed and felt cold sweat drip down his arms. Yet suddenly he could no longer hear his heartbeat, his breathing even, only the sound of her breathing, her life, her identity. Even though Dusty believed her soul would survive his attack, he did not think her personality would. He believed, in heaven, no soul could remember having been on Earth. He believed that it would be impossible to enjoy true peace with such memories, especially with such memories as he had. Nancy would be Nancy for only a second more. </p><p> Dusty tossed the towel onto her face. </p><p> It landed smoothly, a tissue drifting over a reclining doll. </p><p> Dusty raised his hammer to strike. </p><p> Just then Nancy sat up. He would have said she bolted upright; she caught him so completely by surprise. Yet she moved so easily, so without fear, that it seemed as if her own mother had awakened her. The towel fell from her face onto her lap. Her eyes popped open and she looked at him. Her expression wasn't one of fright or surprise, although she was only partially awake. There wasn't a hint of recognition in her expression. Her voice came out like that of a small yawning child. </p><p> "Hello," she said. </p><p> Dusty struck with his hammer. Because he meant to hit her as she lay flat on her back, his blow landed at an odd angle. The hammer smashed her forehead, between the eyebrows, but the bulk of the force of the blow was directed lower. He ended up crushing the bridge of her nose. He actually heard the faint sound of shattering cartilage.

He lives in Inverness, Florida.1<br>XANTHIN BOX<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Bryce smelled a rat.<br>He sighed. He knew what it meant. He would have to clean up the garage. At least until he found the dead rat.<br>So he started in. He was eighty years old, and increasingly absentminded, so if he encountered something that needed doing, he generally did it immediately, lest he forget. The stench of the rat would not ease on its own if ignored. The body would be there somewhere, buried under or behind assorted junk. If he could get at it.<br>It had been some time since he had shaped up the garage. In fact he had mostly stopped coming in here, since he gave up driving, and things had pretty much accumulated on their own. But in time it would need to be cleared out, when the house was put on the market, because&#x2014;<br>Because Bryce had between one and two years left to live. His doctor had given him the word: he had type two diabetes because he had grown too fat, and his blood vessels were three-quarters clogged because he had eaten too many fatty snacks, and the formerly inert prostate cancer was beginning to become assertive because, well, just because. He had to exercise, reduce his weight, and stop sleeping so much in front of the TV. He needed to get out and interact with other people, becoming more social. He needed to challenge his brain instead of being a mental sponge. Or else.<br>Bryce had lacked the gumption to do any of those things. Exercise was too much work, and his fading eyesight made it harder to recognize people. So he was faced with the or else. That meant he would die, and his house would be sold in the process of putting his estate in order. It wasn&#x2019;t much of an estate; forty-odd years of office work had not paid any fortune. The two of them had been comfortable, however, not requiring much.<br>Then Bev had died, and any remaining ambition Bryce might have had had dissipated like windblown smoke. He existed; that was most of what was to be said for him. Their sons had expressed concern, but they had lives and families of their own, as did their grown children, his grandchildren, so they mostly left Bryce alone. His increasing grouchiness of age might have had something to do with it.<br>He got to work, slowly, because he did not have a lot of energy to spare. He might have to do the job in installments, until he penetrated to the rat&#x2019;s nest, wherever it was. Too bad odor was not more specific, so that he could orient on it efficiently and be done with the distasteful chore. As it was, he would soon be grimy, because layers of dust covered everything. Roaches and silverfish skittered away, resenting the disturbance. Bryce grimaced; he should have donned gloves for this dirty work, but naturally hadn&#x2019;t thought of it. It was just too complicated to go back to fetch them from the house, assuming he could find them.<br>Almost immediately he had to fight off a wave of nostalgia. There were things here dating back decades, to when the family was more active and ambitious. Useless things that he had not been able to throw out, because that would have been like discarding part of his wife, or a son, or a friend, or his own youth. He knew it was foolish, but he just couldn&#x2019;t do it. So the junk accumulated, reminders of hopelessly faded memories.<br>He had lived a mediocre existence, and not entirely because he had to. He had made obvious mistakes of judgment and passion, and paid for them. If he could somehow live his indifferent life over, he would be a lot smarter about that. He would do the right thing instead of the convenient thing, the decent act instead of the selfish one, the prudent decision instead of the reckless one. He might not be richer or better known or respected, but he would be a better man. That would count for a lot, personally.<br>For one thing, he should have made more of his ability to sketch. He was no artist, and had never worked with paints, but if he had a pencil and paper he could sketch anything he saw, accurately enough so that others could immediately recognize it. He still liked to draw things; the house was piled with old pencil pictures, and he always kept a stubby pencil and a little notepad in his pocket. It was his sole creative expression, and it made him feel good. Had he taken art courses, who knew what he might have made of it? So he would definitely follow up on that.<br>And a fat lot of good that resolution was, at this stage in his wasted term! It was easy to make fine resolutions when there was no prospect of having to follow through on them.<br>But he was woolgathering, one of his bad habits. It was time to get back to work.<br>Here was an old push-lawnmower, overwhelmed by cobwebs, as dated in its fashion as Bryce was in his own. There was a similarly old circular rattan chair, once a comfortable novelty, but in recent decades useless because Bryce knew that once he sat in it, he would not be able to get back out of it. It was piled with junk: a bucket of dry-rotting wooden clothespins for laundry that no longer got hung out to dry in the sun, a bag of tattered clothing that Bev might once have worn, an empty picture frame that could have pictured his present empty life, several battered paperback novels that would never be reread, and a bright yellow box.<br>Bryce didn&#x2019;t recognize that last. Could a granddaughter have left it here? But no granddaughter had been here in the past decade, and this wasn&#x2019;t the kind of thing to be left and forgotten. It was too pretty: it almost glowed with a xanthin luster. Also, there was no dust on it, so it couldn&#x2019;t have been here long. Yet who could have left it here? The garage was locked from the outside, and the neighbors were not the kind to intrude. It was as if it had simply floated in on its own and found a place to perch.<br>In a moment he realized something odd but surely significant: the dead-rat odor emanated from the box. Such an awful smell from such a lovely object! Could that be coincidence? It had the one fragrance that was guaranteed to make him search it out promptly. So it must have been placed for him to find.<br>He picked it up and opened it. Inside were three objects: a tiny pillbox containing a yellow capsule, a small vial of yellow fluid, and a bound yellow notebook. Each had lettering on it. The pillbox said FBU NF, the vial said ESJOL NF, and the notebook said SFBE NF. What did it mean?<br>Bryce had never been any genius, but in the old days he had diverted himself with newspaper word puzzles. That repeated NF looked like a two-letter word. There were only so many of them. Suppose the letter B were substituted for the letter A? The letter F for the letter E? A childishly simple transcription.<br>And just like that he had it. The pill said EAT ME, the vial said DRINK ME, and the notebook said READ ME.<br>Like Alice in Wonderland. Who knew what effect such things might have on a person? Nothing magical, surely, but they could be candy&#x2014;or poison. It was best to leave them alone.<br>Except that someone must have left them for him. Why? He had no close friends anymore; they had all died. Similarly, he had no enemies. What possible reason could any stranger have had for such an obscure contact? This was curious indeed.<br>Well, hell: what did he have to lose? He took the pill and swallowed it.<br>Nothing happened. So much for that.<br>He unstopped the vial and drank its few drops of golden elixir. It was neutral in taste. Again, nothing. What had he really expected?<br>So he opened the book and started reading. It was in the same code, so he had to change the words letter by letter, tediously. It was a curious, probably nonsensical message.<br>THIS IS A SECRET ONE-WAY PORTAL TO THE LAND OF XANTH. TO ACTIVATE IT, SPEAK THE MAGIC WORDS<br>He paused. What magic words? It didn&#x2019;t provide them.<br>This must be someone&#x2019;s idea of a joke. Bryce tucked the book in a pocket and went on with his cleanup, since he was now well into it and had nothing better to do.<br>He discovered his old recumbent tricycle, buried under more junk. He hauled it out and brushed it off. The chain was oil-caked but seemed serviceable. The tires were solid rubber; he had gotten tired of repairing punctures and switched to these ones that might wear out in time but would never go flat. The trike should be ridable despite its long neglect.<br>And what about him? Could he still ride it? Balancing was tricky on such machines, because the rider was low to the ground. He had learned the art, but his old reflexes might not be up to the challenge. Still, the trike should be secure against even his clumsiness. It was a bike, not a trike, that required balance. He had been confusing the two, in true senior moment fashion.<br>Well, hell, again. He opened the garage door and hauled the trike out onto the pavement. He would try it, and if he crashed, well, that was the luck of the draw.<br>&#x201c;Ruff.&#x201d;<br>Startled, Bryce looked up. There was a dog. Female, healthy, older, with short black and white hair, fairly solid, with somewhat floppy ears. He was generally familiar with dogs, but did not recognize this one. &#x201c;Well, what breed are you?&#x201d; he asked.<br>She shrugged, obviously unable to answer the question.<br>Bryce left the trike and approached the dog. &#x201c;May I? I want to look at your tag.&#x201d; It was always best to approach any strange canine cautiously, though this one seemed friendly.<br>She shrugged again. Taking that as a yes, he petted her shoulder, then reached for her collar. There was none. Evidently there had been one, but somehow it had been lost along with the tags.<br>&#x201c;You must be lost,&#x201d; Bryce said. &#x201c;And maybe hungry and thirsty. Let me fetch you some water and whatever else I can rouse up. Wait here.&#x201d;<br>He went back into the garage, glancing back. The dog lay down in place, doing what he had asked. That was a good sign.<br>He entered the house, found a pan and some leftover pie, and brought them out. He set them down before the dog. &#x201c;Sorry it&#x2019;s not more. It&#x2019;s all I have at the moment.&#x201d;<br>She merely looked at him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; he said reassur...</p><h2>The Moon and the Virgin: Reflections on the Archetypal Feminine</h2><p>Will be shipped from US.

The myths and their figures are familiar - the moon, the mother, the old wise woman, Amazon, Aphrodite, Psyche and her search - but her way of being with her symbols is fresh, bold, and especially sensitive. Jung, Olson, Brown, Duncan have taught her the art of psychic speech. So, here is a psychology book saved from the blight of psychological jargon, because, as she says, 'I refer to myths and fairy tales as essential psychic facts . . .' It's a book that lets us read those facts." - James Hillman<br> <br> "This is an original contribution to the psychology of women. A 'feminine mode of knowing' stressing awareness of the interdependence of all things underlies Hall's approach and makes her scholarly book a rewarding adventure." -Publisher's Weekly<br> <br> "[In] sensitive essays that meander through a wide intellectual landscape, Hall sees the various images of the Feminine as clustering around four poles: the Mother, the Amazon, the Hetaira, and the Medial Woman. By retelling and analyzing stories . . . she wants to flesh out these four archetypes and in the process help people recover some of the meaning and modes of existence which have been suppressed by the patriarchy . . . She does it gracefully, with a broad array of quotations and good literary sense . . . Stimulating." -Kirkus ReviewsNor Hall writes with a strikingly original perspective on women in myth and literature, examining and giving new meaning to the underlying archetypes. She explores such principles as androgyny and virginity, freeing them from the limited social context in which we have trapped them, and argues the necessity of feminine rituals in history.<br> <br> In her search for the original forms of the feminine, Hall has insisted that imagination is as valuable a tool as reason. She guides the reader on a journey through myths and symbols, confronting these not in the rational mode of the language itself, but on the deeper level of the unconscious life. Hall views the process as a modern form of the rites of passage, in which the initiate loses a part of herself, in groping through darkness toward this part acquaints herself with Mnemosyne, the memory of dreams, and thus is born a new way to the world.</p><h2>An Uncommon Woman: Empress Frederick, Daughter of Queen Victoria, Wife of the Crown Prince of Prussia</h2><p>A retelling of the life of Princess Victoria, the daughter of Queen Victoria, who married the Crown Prince of Prussia and gave birth to Kaiser Wilhelm, vividly portrays an era of ambition, war, and revolution. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>Hannah Pakula attended Wellesley College, the Sorbonne and Southern Methodist University. She is a book reviewer for the Los Angeles Times.Pakula, author of the brilliant biography of Queen Marie of Romania, <i>The Last Romantic</i> (1985), proffers a definitive biography of a historical figure well deserving of such a monumental treatment. Her new subject possessed impeccable credentials in the scheme of nineteenth-century European royalty: Princess Royal of Britain, then crown princess of Prussia, and finally German empress. Vicky, as she was called in the family, was the eldest child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and was also easily the cleverest of their vast brood. Her idealistic father arranged her marriage to the heir of the Prussian throne to spread liberal ideas to that reactionary country. The marriage went off as planned, and Vicky loved her handsome prince, Fritz, and he vice versa; they quickly grew to be partners in liberalism. But Vicky was never able to truly shake the foundations of the conservative Prussian monarchy, mainly because of Reich chancellor Prince Bismarck, her nemesis, but also because her husband was too ill and reigned too briefly (88 days) to make real changes. Adding injury to insult, her son, the Kaiser Bill we fought in World War I, reversed the little good Vicky had done in bringing notions of constitutionalism to an autocratic regime by trying to pretend his mother had never existed! Pakula plunges the reader deeply into European politics, but the water is not only fine, it is exhilarating. <i>Brad Hooper</i></p><h2>The Broken Sphere: Spelljammer : the Cloakmaster Cycle, Book 5</h2><p>Teldin Moore finally locates the great ship Spelljammer but claiming the ship proves to be difficult.

Understanding the layers of fabric, trimming, padding, and webbing that give a chair or a sofa its curves and contours can seem like learning a new language. How do you handle the practicalities of repairing the old innards, calculating new yardage, cutting pieces to fit properly, and achieving smooth coverage, let alone the aesthetic considerations of determining the appropriate fabric and trim choices? <i>Simply Upholstery</i> takes the guesswork out of all these problems and more, in straightforward, thorough, step-by-step instructions, supplemented by excellent color diagrams. Since individual furniture pieces vary so widely in design and dimension, the general directions are geared toward solid basic technique that can be applied to many styles of sofas and chairs. To show the entire process in action, the final section offers detailed color photos tracking all 50 steps of reupholstering a traditional wing chair.

Here was no simple narrative of a sea voyage, and here was the antithesis of a self-serving Hollywood memoir.</strong></p><p>Sterling Hayden was at the peak of his earning power as a star when he suddenly quit. He walked out on Hollywood, walked out of a shattered marriage, defied the courts, and, broke and an outlaw, set sail with his four children in the schooner <em>Wanderer</em>--bound for the South Seas.</p><p>Long before he was an actor, Hayden was a seaman. He had sailed before the mast and as mate and captain in sailing ships. He had been a Grand Banks fisherman. Then Hollywood offered him a screen test. Pushed to stardom, he became the leading man to one of the screen's most beautiful women, and the money began to flow. With money and fame, however, came a gnawing dissatisfaction with his life.</p><p>His attempt to escape launches this autobiography. It is the candid, sometimes painfully revealing confession of a man who scrutinizes his every self-defeat and self-betrayal in the unblinking light of conscience. It is also the triumph of a complex and contradictory man, still a rebel and a seeker, undefeated by his failure to find himself in love, adventure, drink, or escape to the South Seas.</p><p>It is, as Eugene Burdick said of it, "utterly fascinating, written by a man who has been able to achieve an honesty about himself which is almost unique."</p></p><p>Review: It&#39;s mighty nice of Sheridan House to reprint Wanderer for a new generation. Many may have missed this treasure its first time around in 1963, and its second printing in &#39;77. The author, Hayden, was a hero to many sailors worldwide, as well as to workaday malcontents &#34;living lives of quiet desperation.&#34; His searching autobiography reads like a novel; indeed, in today&#39;s vanilla world, with horizons shrinking for Everyman, Hayden&#39;s story seems a fantasy. Rest assured, it&#39;s not... He thumbed his nose at the movie industry, his ex-wife, and a judge&#39;s order forbidding him to take his children to sea in the ex-pilot schooner Wanderer. He sailed off to Tahiti anyway, deeply in debt, taking his children and a crew of friends. His defiance made big news. It made Hayden a public hero again, for lots of men longed to tell their bosses to shove it. Hayden did it, and it made perfect sense to a lot of us. When his book came out, we rushed to buy it. Our reward was an exceptional tale, especially for sailors."An impressive writer. Like Fitzgerald, Hayden is a romantic. His writing about the sea evokes echoes of Conrad and McFee, of London and Galsworthy... Beautifully done." --Robert Kirsch, Los Angeles Times <p>"A superb piece of writing...

She'd let the first two shoves go. A quick glance back at the tattooed man convinced her to ignore this one, too. The man towered over her, wearing camouflage pants and a muscle T-shirt. No signs of a coat. Quite a strange fashion statement considering it was twenty degrees outside and snowing, but not a bad idea in the crowded mall.<br><br>Even with a glance it would have been hard for Rebecca not to notice the purple-and-green dragon that snaked down the man's arm, its tail curling up around his neck and its fire-breathing head squeezing out of the T-shirt's tight arm-hole. The tattoo crawled all the way down past the man's elbow. The same elbow that kept finding its way into the middle of Rebecca's shoulder blades.<br><br>She told herself to be patient. She could finally see the order counter as the line to the mall's coffee bar grew shorter. It wouldn't be much longer. She tried to concentrate on the Christmas music, what she could hear of it through the crowd's chatter and the temper tantrums of impatient toddlers.<br><br><em>"...in a winter wonderland."</em><br><br>She loved that song. But it certainly didn't feel like winter in here. Sweat trickled down her back. She wished she had left her coat back with Dixon and Patrick who were guarding a rare find, a bistro table and four chairs in the mall's over crowded food court.<br><br>Rebecca hummed with the music. She knew all the words. They had sung Christmas songs on their long road trip. Connecticut to Minnesota. Twenty-one hours. Thirteen hundred miles. Surviving on Red Bull, convenience-store coffee and McDonalds. She hadn't caught up yet on sleep although yesterday they all crashed after Thanksgiving dinner at Dixon's grandparents' house. The first holiday meal she'd had in years&#x2014;turkey, dressing, real mashed potatoes and all the trimmings. Granddad said a blessing. Nanna served seconds whether you asked for them or not. Dixon had no clue how lucky he was. Family, tradition, stability, unconditional love. It gave Rebecca hope to see those things still existed despite being absent from her family's life.<br><br>Another elbow.<br><br><em>Damn!</em><br><br>She resisted looking back this time.<br><br><em>What in the world was she doing here?</em><br><br>She hated malls and yet here she was on the day after Thanksgiving, the busiest shopping day and craziest shopping crowd of the year. She'd let Dixon talk her into it, just like this whole trip, convincing her it'd be an adventure she'd never forget. He'd been doing crap like that since they were in kindergarten and he convinced her paste tasted like cotton candy. You'd think she'd learn by now that Dixon's taste for adventure was pretty much like his taste for cotton candy, tame and sugar-coated, the hype being the most exciting part of anything Dixon did. What did she expect from a guy who quoted Batman and Robin?<br><br>And poor Patrick, along for the ride, trying to be the good sport.<br><br><em>Patrick.</em><br><br>He was a whole different story. She should have found Patrick's behavior endearing. Instead, she thought it a bit suspicious that this totally cool and together guy would want to travel 1300 miles to spend Thanksgiving with her and Dixon. Seemed a long way to go just to get inside her pants.<br><br><em>That wasn't fair.</em><br><br>She knew he didn't have any family to keep him in Connecticut over the long holiday weekend. His mom was in Green Bay. He had a stepsister in D.C. He'd asked if they could cut through Wisconsin on the way back, like that was part of his excuse to go along. That maybe they could just drop in and say "hi" to his mom. <em>But no big deal if it didn't happen.</em><br><br>That was Patrick. Low-key, mature, steady as a rock. Dixon called it "boring." Rebecca called it dependable and she liked that about Patrick even if she wasn't so sure about his intentions. Dependable felt good. Having Patrick along felt good, though she didn't like admitting that even to herself.<br><br>They'd become friends working at Champs across from the University of New Haven. Patrick tended bar and Rebecca waited tables. She wasn't old enough to serve drinks to the table and if there wasn't another "of age" waitress working then Patrick did it for her, always so patient about it even when he was swamped behind the bar.<br><br><em>Patient, kind, gentle...very suspicious.</em><br><br>Pretty weird, or maybe just sad and pathetic, that she found all that suspicious. Mostly in the beginning. Not so much anymore. Next to Dixon, Patrick was her best friend. Her mom didn't think it was normal for Rebecca to have boys as best friends.<br><br>"Are you having sex with these boys?" her mom wanted to know. Then when Rebecca told her "absolutely not," her mom seemed even more perplexed.<br><br>"You're not a lesbian, are you?" her mom had asked and quickly added, "Not that there's anything wrong with that."<br><br>In the last three years Rebecca had watched her mom and dad yell their way through a divorce. Her dad immediately married the coworker he claimed to have just met. Her mother reciprocated with her own stream of men. After watching the two of them, Rebecca had long ago made the decision to concentrate on her future, to use their love life catastrophes as inspiration. Her future was her escape and she wouldn't allow someone, dysfunctional parents or a boyfriend, to screw that up for her.<br><br>Besides, her love for animals, especially dogs, was the one thing Rebecca knew without question. Taking care of them, healing them would save her. She looked to it as her salvation from an otherwise dreary, miserable life. She knew veterinary school would be a long haul, but she was willing to put in the tough hours. Maybe someday have her own clinic. That and a pack of dogs, a couple of horses, some cats, too. Her mom wouldn't even let her have a small dog in their post-divorce condo. It was just as well. Not having someone she was obligated to, had made it easier to leave for college and live on campus. Same theory went for not having someone to hold her back, distract her from her dream.<br><br>When her mom asked if she was coming home for Thanksgiving, Rebecca's first inclination was to blurt out that she didn't have a home. But her mom wouldn't have understood. And she certainly wouldn't have allowed Rebecca to travel halfway across the country with Dixon and Patrick, so Rebecca lied.<br><br><em>No, not really a lie.</em><br><br>She simply told her mom that her dad had asked her to spend Thanksgiving with his new family. That was actually true. He had asked her to join them on their extravagant Thanksgiving trip to Jamaica. It wasn't Rebecca's fault that her mom hadn't checked it out, that she would rather swallow fire than talk to her ex-husband.<br><br>By the time Rebecca made her way back to the table, Patrick had gotten a Cinnabon for each of them. From the look on Dixon's face she knew Patrick was making him wait for her.<br><br><em>Add dependable and courteous to that list.</em><br><br>It made Rebecca smile just as Andy Williams started singing, "I'll be Home for Christmas." The mall must have the same Christmas CD collection that Dixon owned.<br><br>Dixon was singing the words to "I'll be Home for Christmas" as she set down his Red Bull and coffees for her and Patrick.<br><br>She barely sat down and he bit off a mouthful of cinnamon roll while popping the tab on his drink. Her friend was charming and talented and witty and totally oblivious to anyone else when he was obsessed. Which was the reason they were here at the mall on the day after Thanksgiving. His latest obsession involved the red backpack at his feet.<br><br>"Chad and Tyler are already here."<br><br>He waved at them across the food court but they even didn't look his way. Typical, but Rebecca didn't point out to Dixon that the two jocks still treated him like an elementary school tag-along. The four of them had gone to school together up until Rebecca's mom dragged her away to Connecticut. Dixon chose West Haven for college partly to be with Rebecca but as soon as he came home to Minnesota, Chad and Tyler could draw him into their escapades with a simple phone call.<br><br>Rebecca noticed they both carried red back packs identical to Dixon's. What did he get himself into this time? She pulled off her coat and let it hang over the back of her chair. She usually stayed away from Dixon's adventures. She wiped at her bangs that were pasted to her forehead and stretched her back expecting it to ache from the tattooed man's elbow.<br><br>"We agreed to start on the third floor and work our way down."<br><br>"What exactly is it you guys are doing?" Patrick asked.<br><br>Rebecca wanted to kick him under the table. Dixon took on causes like they were T-shirts with slogans that he changed every other week. Most likely this was Chad and Tyler's idea. Dixon read Vince Flynn novels and super hero comic books&#x2014;Batman was currently his favorite. He did a cool imitation of Homer Simpson and knew all the characters from <em>Lord of the Rings</em>. Not only could he find Venus, and sometimes Mars, in the night sky, he could name all three stars in Orion's Belt. When he told Rebecca he had decided to major in cyber-crime, she couldn't imagine him stepping out of his fantasy world long enough to deal with real life criminals. He was a smart, quirky guy and Rebecca hoped he'd realize soon that he didn't need Chad and Tyler.<br><br>"Do you realize that eighty percent of toys sold in the U.S.A. are made in China?" Dixon told Patrick as he stuffed another piece of cinnamon roll into his mouth. "And that's just toys. Don't even get me started about other products. Like those cute little patriotic flag pins everyone puts on their lapels...made in China." He drew out the phrase like it was all the proof he needed to substantiate his argument. Never mind that it sounded like he had memorized it from some pamphlet.<br><br>Patrick glanced at Rebecca as he sipped his coffee. She winced, wanting to tell him it was too late.<br><br>"Over a half million production jobs were outsourced to other countries last year," Dixon continued. "Just to make everyday products that we can't live without."<br><br>"Like your new iPhone," Rebecca said pointing to the gadget in Dixon's shirt pocket, the earbuds a constant fixture dangling around his neck. "Made in China but you can't live without it."<br><br>"These are different." He rolled his eyes for Patrick as if saying she didn't know what she was talking about. "Besides, this was a gift, a reward, in exchange for lugging around this backpack all day."<br><br>"Ahh," Rebecca said and didn't have to add that she knew there had to be a catch.<br><br>"And I can live without it, Miss Smartypants," he added.<br><br>"Really?" Rebecca raised an eyebrow to challenge him.<br><br>"Of course."<br><br>She put out her hand. "Then loan it to me for the day. You owe me for losing my cell phone."<br><br>"I didn't lose it. I just haven't remembered where I placed it."<br><br>But already Dixon's smile disappeared as if he was trying to contemplate life without immediate access and communication to the world. Just when she thought he couldn't bear to relinquish it, he pulled the cord from around his neck and slid the cord and the iPhone across the table to her. The smile reappeared.<br><br>"Don't break it. I just got it."<br><br>"What about the backpack?" Patrick asked.<br><br>Both Rebecca and Dixon looked at him as though they completely forgot what they had been talking about. Patrick pointed to the pack at Dixon's feet.<br><br>"What's the deal with the backpack?" he asked again.<br><br>"That, my friend, contains the secret weapon." Dixon was back to his infomercial. "Inside is an ingenious contraption that will emit a wireless signal. Completely harmless," he waved his hand, "but enough interference to mess up a few computer systems. Wake up a few of these retailers. Last time I was home Chad and Tyler took me to a rally with this cool professor at UMN, drives a Harley, one of the big ones."<br><br>Rebecca couldn't help but smile. Dixon wouldn't know a Harley from a Yamaha, but she didn't say anything.<br><br>"This is a guy who's been in the trenches, knows what he's talking about. You know, he's been to the Middle East, Afghanistan, Russia, China. Professor Ryan says that until we hit people in the almighty pocketbook nobody's gonna care that we outsource hundreds of thousands of jobs every year or that the southern invasion is stealing twice that many jobs right here, right out from under us."<br><br>"Southern invasion?" It was Rebecca's turn to roll her eyes at Dixon. She'd lived through many of his obsessions and humored him by listening to all of his rants, but once in a while she had to let him know she couldn't take him seriously. Next week Dixon would probably move on to saving beached whales.<br><br>"So why the padlock?" Patrick asked, still interested.<br><br>Dixon shrugged like it didn't matter, that the padlock was a minor point and besides, he was finished with his spiel. Rebecca recognized the look. He was ready and impatient, looking over his shoulder, concerned with finding Chad and Tyler. That's when she knew this idea was probably theirs. Not Dixon's. But he'd go along, wanting to be friends with the cool guys, the high school jocks he grew up following around. They were always getting Dixon in trouble and she didn't under stand why he kept going back for more. Maybe another semester away at college, away from them, would help.<br><br></p><h2>Haunting Legacy: Vietnam and the American Presidency from Ford to Obama</h2><p><p>The United States had never lost a war&#x2014;that is, until 1975, when it was forced to flee Saigon in humiliation after losing to what Lyndon Johnson called a "raggedy-ass little fourth-rate country." The legacy of this first defeat has haunted every president since, especially on the decision of whether to put "boots on the ground" and commit troops to war.</p><p>In <i>Haunting Legacy</i>, the father-daughter journalist team of Marvin Kalb and Deborah Kalb presents a compelling, accessible, and hugely important history of presidential decisionmaking on one crucial issue: in light of the Vietnam debacle, under what circumstances should the United States go to war? </p><p>The sobering lesson of Vietnam is that the United States is not invincible&#x2014;it can lose a war&#x2014;and thus it must be more discriminating about the use of American power. Every president has faced the ghosts of Vietnam in his own way, though each has been wary of being sucked into another unpopular war. Ford (during the <i>Mayaguez</i> crisis) and both Bushes (Persian Gulf, Iraq, Afghanistan) deployed massive force, as if to say, "Vietnam, be damned." On the other hand, Carter, Clinton, and Reagan (to the surprise of many) acted with extreme caution, mindful of the Vietnam experience. Obama has also wrestled with the Vietnam legacy, using doses of American firepower in Libya while still engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p><p>The authors spent five years interviewing hundreds of officials from every post war administration and conducting extensive research in presidential libraries and archives, and they've produced insight and information never before published. Equal parts taut history, revealing biography, and cautionary tale, <i>Haunting Legacy</i> is must reading for anyone trying to understand the power of the past to influence war-and-peace decisions of the present, and of the future.</p></p><p><p><b>Marvin Kalb</b> is the Edward R.

There are no mile-long lists of instructions, the recipes use readily available ingredients, and many can be prepared in thirty minutes or less. Some of the recipes are taken directly from the kitchens of Vongerichten's three restaurants--Jean Georges, Vong, and JoJo. They not only sound simple but are simple--and irresistible. Fennel and Apple Salad with Juniper. 10-minute Green Gazpacho. Saut�ed Chicken with Green Olives and Cilantro.

All it takes is the inspired recipes and innovative techniques of Jean-Georges.</p><p>Interested in terrific food? Good. The first thing to do is buy this book. Then clear your calendar for the next 150 days. At a recipe a day, that's how long it will take to go from cover to cover. Your old life? Buy this book and kiss your old life goodbye. You won't regret it.<p> Most recipes that come out of high-end restaurant kitchens either aren't feasible in a home kitchen with home cooking skills, or they produce the kind of contrived food you wouldn't think to serve--the kind of food you go out to a restaurant to have served to you.</p><p> Jean-Georges Vongerichten, on the other hand, has moved in the direction of ultimate, minimal simplicity with heightened, surprising flavors as the payoff. His Steak with Red Wine Reduction and Carrot Pur�e, a popular restaurant dish, simply asks that the cook reduce a bottle of red wine to a single cup, stir in carrot pur�e, and use this as a sauce on a grilled steak. If that sounds like a gimmick, consider that his Manhattan restaurants--Jean-Georges, Vong, JoJo--receive lavish, stunning reviews. And it's all about the food. It's all about finding flavors and textures in your mouth that have never been there before. </p><p> In his life and career, Jean-Georges Vongerichten has moved from the foods of his home in France, across Asia, and finally to New York. When the food media was first beginning to talk about "fusion" cuisine, that all-too-often forced marriage of classic French and Asian cooking techniques and ingredients, Jean-Georges had already blown on by into a realm of his own making. </p><p> The results of his insight and energy are in this book. This is easy, elegant, flavorful food: Cold Tomato Soup with Cucumber and Cantaloupe, for example, or Salmon in a Cardamom Broth. You won't cook, eat, or taste anything the same old way once you tuck this book and this food experience under your wing. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>"Jean-Georges is one of today's most innovative and influential chefs. This book contains the essence of what makes him great: his ability to bring out the best in whatever he cooks. The flavor combinations practically jump off the pages and send you straight to the kitchen."<br>--Thomas Keller, The French Laundry<p>"As Mark Bittman so correctly states in his informative introduction, one of the many talents of Jean-Georges is his capacity to make what seem like simple preparations taste so incredibly complex. This book makes his skills readily available to the home cook."<br>--Daniel Boulud, chef/owner of Restaurant Daniel and Caf Boulud</p><p></p></p><h2>Witchcraft in Europe, 1100-1700: A Documentary History (The Middle Ages Series)</h2><p><p>In bringing together a rich collection of contemporary accounts of the period, this volume chronicles the rise and fall of the cult of witchcraft that swept through Europe between the 11th and 18th centuries.</p></p><p><p>"Comprehensive, original, scholarly, philosophically searching and meticulously prepared. . . .

Hirschi focuses on the salmon, the forests, and the cultural expression known as the potlach. Tying all three areas together is the author's call for stewardship of the Earth and its resources. Cooper shows that she has really looked at the native people of the Pacific?at their art, and at their surroundings. Her gently colorful line drawings combine detailed, realistic images of past and present inhabitants, their artifacts, and the wild creatures that share the land. A number of archival photos add documentation. However, liveliness is at a premium here, and the first pages alone preview problems of flatness, repetition, and confusing references. The book opens with excerpts from Chief Seattle's 1850 speech, welcoming both the white man and the annual salmon. (Here and elsewhere, the "famous" 1855 speech is mentioned too obliquely for this audience.) Four paragraphs later, the text says that "one of the biggest problems arrived...at the moment" of the speech. Was that the salmon, then, or whites? When the text claims, "You can learn much about how Northwest Coast Indians live without destroying the sea, the ancient forests, and the rivers," it's not clear whether it's whites or Indians who are the potential destroyers. If the confusion is minimal, the lack of verve is pervasive: this worthy subject and these attractive pictures deserve more graceful prose.?Patricia (Dooley) Lothrop Green, St. George's School, Newport, RI<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Man Who Rode Midnight</h2><p>Wes Hendricks begins a one-man war against his family, friends, and the harsh realities of time to hold on to the land he loves</p><p>This warmly human story about a generation gap that closes is set in west Texas of the 1980s where the old and new ways are in serious conflict.

For forty years, the restaurant and its founder, legendary chef Alice Waters, has had a profound influence on food, farming, cooking, and dining around the world. In the beginning, Waters saw the beauty and aesthetic of fine printing as a way to communicate at the outset of the diners' experience the care and attention given to the preparation of their dinner. Berkeley-based artist Patricia Curtan began hand printing menus for the restaurant during its early years, while employed as a cook in the Chez Panisse kitchen. Curtan's menus, works of art in their own right, capture the unique spirit of the famous restaurant with letterpress and linoleum-block prints on beautiful paper. In <em>Menus for Chez Panisse</em>, Curtan presents four decades of menus including dinners for special guests such as Julia Child, Hillary Clinton, Mikhail Baryshnikov, and James Beard with notes about the menus, the artwork, the occasions, and, of course, the food.</p><p>"....a nice surprise since i've admired the hand carved and printed designs of the famous berkeley restaurant for so long. the book is a collections of forty years of artwork by patricia curtain....would make [a] really nice gift for those interested in printing." --Lena Corwin<br><br>"Whether you're interested in letterpress and printmaking, Chez Panisse and Alice Waters, or food ephemera, you'll find something of value in this beautiful book." --Epicurious.com<br><br>"Some menus are now so iconic - radishes tied in a bundle, ripe figs still on the branch - that they evoke not only Chez Panisse but an entire era of food." -- T: The New York Times Magazine<br><br>"Menus for Chez Panisse awes.... a shockingly impressive and addictive tome.... we strongly recommend.

Although every town in France has a street named for Pasteur, was he alone able to stop people from spitting, persuade them to dig drains, influence them to undergo vaccination? Pasteur's success depended upon a whole network of forces, including the public hygiene movement, the medical profession (both military physicians and private practitioners), and colonial interests. It is the operation of these forces, in combination with the talent of Pasteur, that Bruno Latour sets before us as a prime example of science in action.<br><br>Latour argues that the triumph of the biologist and his methodology must be understood within the particular historical convergence of competing social forces and conflicting interests. Yet Pasteur was not the only scientist working on the relationships of microbes and disease. How was he able to galvanize the other forces to support his own research? Latour shows Pasteur's efforts to win over the French public--the farmers, industrialists, politicians, and much of the scientific establishment.<br><br>Instead of reducing science to a given social environment, Latour tries to show the simultaneous building of a society and its scientific facts. The first section of the book, which retells the story of Pasteur, is a vivid description of an approach to science whose theoretical implications go far beyond a particular case study. In the second part of the book, "Irreductions," Latour sets out his notion of the dynamics of conflict and interaction, of the "relation of forces." Latour's method of analysis cuts across and through the boundaries of the established disciplines of sociology, history, and the philosophy of science, to reveal how it is possible not to make the distinction between reason and force. Instead of leading to sociological reductionism, this method leads to an unexpected irreductionism.</p><p><p>Bruno Latour is Professor at Sciences Po, Paris, and the 2013 winner of the Ludvig Holberg International Memorial Prize.</p><p>Alan Sheridan is the author of <i>Michel Foucault: The Will to Truth</i>.

I truly believe those were the only times the driver used the brakes. At the last checkpoint, I was copiously sick, narrowly missing the guard&#x2019;s boots. He didn&#x2019;t even bother checking our papers, just lifted the red and white pole and waved us on with a look of disgust.<br><br>&#x201c;Driver! Pull over,&#x201d; said Ellis, who was sitting in the backseat between Hank and me.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid there is no &#x2018;over,&#x2019; &#x201d; the driver said in a thick Highland accent, his R&#x2019;s rolling magnificently. He came to a stop in the middle of the road.<br><br>It was true. If I stepped outside the car I would be ankle-deep in thorny vegetation and mud, not that it would have done any more to destroy my clothes and shoes. From head to toe I was steeped in sulfur and cordite and the stench of fear. My stockings were mere cobwebs stretched around my legs, and my scarlet nails were broken and peeling. I hadn&#x2019;t had my hair done since the day before we&#x2019;d sailed from the shipyard in Philadelphia. I had never been in such a state.<br><br>I leaned out the open door and gagged while Ellis rubbed my back. Wet snow collected on the top of my head.<br><br>I sat up again and pulled the door shut. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I&#x2019;m finished. Do you think you can take those things off the headlights? I think it would be better if I could see what&#x2019;s coming.&#x201d; I was referring to the slotted metal plates our one-eyed driver had clipped on before we&#x2019;d left the base. They limited visibility to about three feet ahead of us.<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he called back cheerfully. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the Blackout.&#x201d; As he cranked up through the gears, my head lurched back and forth. I leaned over and cradled my face in my hands.<br><br>Ellis patted my shoulder. &#x201c;We should be nearly there. Do you think fresh air would help?&#x201d;<br><br>I sat up and let my head flop against the back of the torn leather seat. Ellis reached across and rolled the window down a crack. I turned toward the cold air and closed my eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;Hank, can you please put out your cigarette?&#x201d;<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t answer, but a whoosh of frigid air let me know he had tossed it out the window.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; I said weakly.<br><br>Twenty minutes later, when the car finally came to a stop and the driver cut the engine, I was so desperate for solid ground I spilled out before the driver could get his own door open, never mind mine. I landed on my knees.<br><br>&#x201c;Maddie!&#x201d; Ellis said in alarm.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m all right,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>There was a fast-moving cloud cover under a nearly full moon, and by its light I first laid eyes on our unlikely destination.<br><br>I climbed to my feet and reeled away from the car, thinking I might be sick again. My legs propelled me toward the building, spinning ever faster. I crashed into the wall, then slid down until I was crouching against it.<br><br>In the distance, a sheep bleated.<br><br>. . .<br><br>To say that I wished I wasn&#x2019;t there would be a ludicrous understatement, but I&#x2019;d only ever had the illusion of choice:<br><br>We have to do this, Hank had said. It&#x2019;s for Ellis.<br><br>To refuse would have been tantamount to betrayal, an act of calculated cruelty. And so, because of my husband&#x2019;s war with his father and their insane obsession with a mythical monster, we&#x2019;d crossed the Atlantic at the very same time a real madman, a real monster, was attempting to take over the world for his own reasons of ego and pride.<br><br>I would have given anything to go back two weeks, to the beginning of the New Year&#x2019;s Eve party, and script the whole thing differently.<br><br>Chapter Two<br><br>Rittenhouse Square, Philadelphia, December 31, 1944<br><br>&#x201c;Five! Four! Three! Two!&#x201d;<br><br>The word &#x201c;one&#x201d; had already formed on our lips, but before it could slide off there was an explosion overhead. As screams rose around us, I pitched myself against Ellis, tossing champagne over both of us. He threw an arm protectively around my head and didn&#x2019;t spill a drop.<br><br>When the screams petered out, I heard a tinkling above us, like glass breaking, along with an ominous groaning. I peeked out from my position against Ellis&#x2019;s chest.<br><br>&#x201c;What the hell?&#x201d; said Hank, without a hint of surprise. I think he was the only person in the room who hadn&#x2019;t jumped.<br><br>All eyes turned upward. Thirty feet above us, a massive chandelier swung on its silver-plated chain, throwing shimmering prisms across the walls and floor. It was as if a rainbow had burst into a million pieces, which were now dancing across the marble, silks, and damask. We watched, transfixed. I glanced nervously at Ellis&#x2019;s face, and then back at the ceiling.<br><br>An enormous cork landed next to General Pew, our host at what was easily the most anticipated party of the year, bouncing outrageously like a bloated mushroom. A split second later a single crystal the size of a quail&#x2019;s egg fell from the sky and dropped smack into his cocktail, all but emptying it. He stared, bemused and tipsy, then calmly took out his handkerchief and dabbed his jacket.<br><br>As everyone burst into laughter, I noticed a footman in old-fashioned knee breeches perched near the top of a stepladder, pallid, motionless, struggling to contain the biggest bottle of champagne I&#x2019;d ever seen. On the marble table in front of him was a structure of glasses arranged so that if someone poured continuously into the top one, they would eventually all be filled. As a rush of bubbles cascaded over the sides of the bottle and into the footman&#x2019;s sleeves, he stared in white-faced horror at Mrs. Pew.<br><br>Hank assessed the situation and apparently took pity on the fellow. He raised his glass, as well as his other hand, and with the flair and flourish of a ringmaster boomed, &#x201c;One! Happy New Year!&#x201d;<br><br>The orchestra struck up &#x201c;Auld Lang Syne.&#x201d; General Pew conducted with his empty glass, and Mrs. Pew beamed at his side&#x2014;not only was her party a smashing success, but it now had a comic anecdote people would speak of for years.<br><br>Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind<br><br>Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and old lang syne . . . <br><br>Those who knew the words sang along. I had refreshed my memory that afternoon in order to be ready for the big moment, but when cork met crystal, the lyrics were knocked straight out of my brain. By the time we got to running about slopes and picking daisies fine, I gave up and joined Ellis and Hank in la-la-la&#x2019;ing our way through the rest.<br><br>They waved their glasses in solidarity with General Pew, their free arms looped around my waist. At the end, Ellis leaned in to kiss me.<br><br>Hank looked to one side, then the other, and appeared baffled.<br><br>&#x201c;Hmm. I seem to have misplaced my date. What have I done with her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What you haven&#x2019;t done is marry her,&#x201d; I said and then snorted, nearly expelling champagne through my nose. I had sipped my way through at least four glasses on an empty stomach and was feeling bold.<br><br>His mouth opened in mock offense, but even he couldn&#x2019;t pretend ignorance about Violet&#x2019;s growing desperation at the seemingly endless nature of their courtship.<br><br>&#x201c;Did she actually leave?&#x201d; he said, scanning the room a little more seriously.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen her in a while.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then who will give me my New Year&#x2019;s kiss?&#x201d; he asked, looking bereft.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, come here, you big lug.&#x201d; I stood on tiptoe and planted a kiss on his cheek. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve always got us. And we don&#x2019;t even require a ring.&#x201d;<br><br>Ellis threw us an amused side eye and motioned to Hank that he should wipe my lipstick off his cheek.<br><br>Beyond him, the footman was still balanced on the second to highest rung of the stepladder. He was bent at the waist, trying to aim the bottle at the top glass, and had gone from pale to purple with the effort. His mouth was pressed into a grim line. I looked around to see if reinforcements were coming and didn&#x2019;t see any.<br><br>&#x201c;Ellis? I think he needs help,&#x201d; I said, tilting my head in the footman&#x2019;s direction.<br><br>Ellis glanced over. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; he said, handing me his glass. &#x201c;Hank? Shall we?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you really think she&#x2019;s left?&#x201d; Hank said wistfully, his lips hovering near the edge of his glass. &#x201c;She was a vision tonight. That dress was the color of the gloaming, the sequins jealous stars in the galaxy of her night, but nothing, nothing could compare to the milky skin of her&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Boys! Concentrate!&#x201d; I said.<br><br>Hank snapped back to life. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maddie thinks that man needs help,&#x201d; said Ellis.<br><br>&#x201c;That thing&#x2019;s enormous,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think he can hold it on his own.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I should think not. That&#x2019;s a Balthazar,&#x201d; said Ellis.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not a Balthazar,&#x201d; Hank said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a Nebuchadnezzar.&#x201d;<br><br>The footman&#x2019;s arms were quaking. He began pouring but missed. Champagne fell between the glasses, splashing onto the table and floor. His gloves and sleeves were saturated.<br><br>&#x201c;Uh-oh,&#x201d; said Hank.<br><br>&#x201c;Uh-oh indeed,&#x201d; said Ellis. &#x201c;Mrs. Pew will not be pleased.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I rather suspect Mrs. Pew is never pleased,&#x201d; Hank said.<br><br>Rivulets of sweat ran down the footman&#x2019;s forehead. It was plain to see that he was going to fall forward, right onto the glasses. I looked to Mrs. Pew for help, but she had disappeared. I tried to signal the General, but he was holding court with a replenished cocktail.<br><br>I dug my elbow into Ellis&#x2019;s side.<br><br>&#x201c;Go!&#x201d; I said urgently. &#x201c;Go help him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s she talking about?&#x201d; said Hank.<br><br>I glared at him, and then some more, until he remembered.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh! Of course.&#x201d; He tried to hand me his glass, but I was already holding two. He set his on the floor and yanked his lapels in a businesslike manner, but before he and Ellis could mobilize, help arrived in the form of other servants bearing four smaller but still very large bottles, and three more stepladders. Mrs. Pew glided in behind them to make sure all was under control.<br><br>&#x201c;Now those are Balthazars,&#x201d; said Hank, with a knowing nod. He retrieved his drink from the floor and drained it.<br><br>&#x201c;No. Those are Jeroboams,&#x201d; said Ellis.<br><br>&#x201c;I think I know my champagne,&#x201d; said Hank.<br><br>&#x201c;And I don&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re both wrong. Those are Ebenezers,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>That stopped them.<br><br>I broke into tipsy giggles. &#x201c;Ebenezer? Get it? Christmas? The holidays? Oh never mind. Someone get me another. I spilled mine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. On me,&#x201d; said Ellis.<br><br>Hank spun around and set his glass on the tray of a passing waiter. He clapped his hands. &#x201c;All right, who&#x2019;s up for a snowball fight?&#x201d;<br><br>We toppled outside and made snow angels right there in front of the Pews&#x2019; home and all the cars and liveried drivers that were lined up waiting for guests. I gathered one snowball and managed to land it on Ellis&#x2019;s chest before screeching and running back inside.<br><br>In the vast foyer, Ellis helped brush the snow off my back and hair. Hank hung his jacket over my bare shoulders, and the two of them guided me to a trio of ornate, embroidered chairs near a roaring fire. Hank, who had had the presence of mind to grab my mink stole on the way back in, shook it off and draped it over the edge of the rosewood table in front of us. Ellis went in search of hot toddies, and I peeled off my gloves, which were stained and soaked.<br><br>&#x201c;God, look at me,&#x201d; I said, gazing down at myself. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a mess.&#x201d;<br><br>My silk dress and shoes were ruined. I tried in vain to smooth out the water spots, and checked quickly to make sure I still had both earrings. The gloves were of no consequence, but I hoped the stole could be saved. If not, I&#x2019;d succeeded in destroying my entire outfit.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not a mess. You&#x2019;re magnificent,&#x201d; said Hank.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I was,&#x201d; I lamented.<br><br>I&#x2019;d spent the afternoon at Salon Antoine having my hair and makeup done, and had eaten almost nothing for two days before so my dress would drape properly. It was a beautiful pomegranate-red silk, the same material as my shoes. It matched my ruby engagement ring, and all of it set off my green eyes. Ellis had given me the dress and shoes a few days earlier, and before the party I had presented myself to him like a flamenco dancer, twirling so the skirt would take flight. He professed his delight, but I felt a familiar pang of sorrow as I tried, yet again, to imagine exactly what he was seeing. My husband was profoundly color-blind, so to him my ensemble must have been a combination of grays. I wondered which ones, and how many variations there were, and whether they had different depths. I couldn&#x2019;t imagine a world without color.<br><br>Hank dropped into a chair, leaving one leg dangling over its arm. He pulled his bow tie open and undid his cuffs and collar. He looked like a half-drowned Clark Gable.<br><br>I shivered into his jacket, holding it closed from the inside.<br><br>Hank patted his chest and sides. He stopped suddenly and lifted an eyebrow.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; I said, realizing what he was looking for. I retrieved the cigarette case from his inside pocket and handed it to him. He flipped it open and held it out in offering. I shook my head. He took a cigarette for himself and snapped the case shut.<br><br>&#x201c;So, how about it then?&#x201d; he said, his eyes glistening playfully. &#x201c;Shall we go get us a monster?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said, waving my hand. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll hop on the next liner.&#x201d; It was what I always said when the topic came up, which was often, and always after boatloads of booze. It was our little game.<br><br>&#x201c;I think getting away would do Ellis good. He seems depressed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ellis isn&#x2019;t depressed,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You just want to escape Violet&#x2019;s clutches.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do not,&#x201d; he protested.<br><br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t even notice when she left tonight!&#x201d;<br><br>Hank cocked his head and nodded, conceding the point. &#x201c;I suppose I should send flowers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;First thing in the morning,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>He nodded. &#x201c;Absolutely. At the crack of noon. Scout&#x2019;s honor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And I think you should marry her. You need civilizing, and I need a female friend. I have only you and Ellis.&#x201d;<br><br>He clutched a hand to his heart, mortally wounded. &#x201c;What are we, chopped liver?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only the finest foie gras. Seriously, though. How long are you going to make her wait?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure. I don&#x2019;t know if I&#x2019;m ready to be civilized yet. But when I am, Violet can have the honors. She can pick a mean set of china.&#x201d;</p><h2>Being and Vibration</h2><p>Joseph Rael (Beautiful Painted Arrow) combines the sacred teachings</p><p>Joseph Rael (Beautiful Painted Arrow) combines the sacred teachings imparted to him while growing up at Picuris Pueblo with knowledge learned during his years of contact with the mainstream culture.

She was an adventurous, independent-minded twenty-one-year-old; Kerouac was already running on empty at thirty-five. This unique book, containing the many letters the two of them wrote to each other, reveals a surprisingly tender side of Kerouac. It also shares the vivid and unusual perspective of what it meant to be young, Beat, and a woman in the Cold War fifties. Reflecting on those tumultuous years, Johnson seamlessly interweaves letters and commentary, bringing to life her love affair with one of American letters' most fascinating and enigmatic figures.</p><p>They met in early 1957, eight months before the publication of <i>On the Road</i> made Jack Kerouac the most famous young writer in America. Some of the bitterest, saddest letters Kerouac wrote to his 21-year-old lover, Joyce Glassman, reveal the personal cost of the hysterical media attention that followed. Yet their early correspondence shows a side of Kerouac not always evident in his fiction: tender, spiritual, and supportive of Glassman's efforts to write her first novel. Now known as Joyce Johnson, she supplements the text of their epistles with commentary whose sensitive, rueful tone will be familiar to readers of her memoir, <i>Minor Characters</i>. The loving but independent air she assumed in her letters, Johnson notes, came from painful rewriting to eliminate all hints of hurt or need; as he wandered in and out of her life, Kerouac kept reminding her he didn't want to be tied down, even as he urged her to come visit whatever city he'd alighted in. Spiced with marvelously evocative period slang like <i>dig</i> and <i>swing</i>, and references to friends such as Allen Ginsberg and Neal Cassady, this poignant epistolary record of a 22-month love affair also brings to life an exciting moment in American cultural history, when the Beat writers gave "powerful, irresistible voices to subversive longings." <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Jack Kerouac(1922-1969), the central figure of the Beat Generation, was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1922 and died in St. Petersburg, Florida, in 1969.

Cyclops and Emma Frost re-form the X-Men with the express purpose of "astonishing" the world. But when breaking news regarding the mutant gene unexpectedly hits the airwaves, will it derail their new plans before they even get started?<br><br> <strong>Collecting:</strong> <br><br> Astonishing X-Men #1-6<br><br></p><p>John Cassaday began his professional career with Negative Burn. It wasn t until he showed his portfolio to Mark Waid at San Diego Comic Con that he began receiving job offers from Dark Horse, DC, and Marvel. He eventually collaborated with Joss Whedon on &#34;Astonishing X-Men&#34; which led to more work and even directing an episode of Whedon s television show, &#34;Dollhouse.&#34; Most recently he helped relaunch the successful &#34;Star Wars&#34; comic franchise alongside Jason Aaron for Marvel Comics.The X-men franchise has remained popular for nearly 30 years by constantly refreshing its story line yet keeping its core group of characters in a variety of unresolved long-running situations. This current incarnation features Whedon (creator of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer franchise) and Cassaday (<i>Planetary</i>) at the top of their game, as they create a highly entertaining action soap opera. The plot involves elements that will be familiar to both old fans and movie viewers&#x2014;antimutant sentiment; tension between team leader Cyclops and lone wolf Wolverine&#x2014;but Whedon's dialogue is fresh and to the point, while Cassaday's detailed and intense art gives all the goings-on a sense of importance. The main story involves a possible cure for the mutant gene that is at the center of a struggle between the X-men and Ord, a murderous alien who has a mysterious personal grudge against the team. Complications include the cat-monkey&#x2013;like Beast pondering whether to attempt to take the cure, possibly vindicating the antimutant forces' belief that mutations are a disease. For those who may not be up to speed on the minutiae of X-history, Whedon brings in returning member Kitty Pryde as a convenient viewpoint character. While a few nods to formula feel forced, this story demonstrates once again why the X-men are the top team in superhero comics. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But routine visits to her general practitioner, Dr. Thomas, weren't that bad. Her office was in a large house, and the airy rooms and front garden were nothing like most National Health Service (NHS) clinics. On this particular day, beckoned by the bright sunshine that had finally broken a long spell of chilly May rain, Helen set out early for the short trip from her North London home to Dr. Thomas's nearby office.<br><br>She got off the bus at the corner of the doctor's street. The tree-lined row of neat stone houses looked just like those in her neighborhood. Tulips still bloomed in a few front gardens; the sun sparkled on a border of deep crimson dahlias. Helen walked slowly down the block, preoccupied by an upcoming meeting at work. She was chief cataloguer at a branch library in one of London's largest boroughs, and tight budgets were creating problems for everyone. Recent staffing cuts had left hundreds of books overflowing her office; she'd almost been hurt the day before when an avalanche of them crashed near the door. With any more layoffs, she'd be left with the work of a whole department.<br><br>Suddenly, a voice yelled, "Who the fuck are you?" Yanked from her reverie, Helen whirled around to see who was shouting at her. She saw no one. "Why ain't you at work?" the same man demanded in a booming tone. "You think doctors have time to waste on scum like you?" Helen froze, shocked that anyone on this quiet street would speak so rudely to her.<br><br>But where was the man? The street was empty. He was foul-mouthed, almost obscene, not the sort of person who'd live in a leafy neighborhood like this. He had to be in one of the houses, yelling through a window; no one was on the sidewalk. "Yeah, who the fuck she think she is, walkin' down the street 'stead a' goin' to work?" a woman's shrill voice rang out. Helen swung around. She still couldn't see anyone. The sounds seemed to be coming from one of the smaller houses she'd just passed. But no one was at the windows; every door was shut. "Get your stinkin' ass out of here," the man snarled. Terrified, Helen began to run. Dr. Thomas's office was at the end of the block. Pushing open the gate so quickly she practically fell through it, she stood for a moment in the garden, trying to catch her breath.<br><br>Whatever had just happened, it was over now, she told herself. Besides, she was at a familiar, safe place, a place of help. Her heart still �ding, Helen rapped on the front door and then, when the buzzer sounded, walked unsteadily to the waiting room just down the hall. Other patients sat reading magazines or chatting quietly with relatives. Two small boys in the corner were giggling over a comic book. Helen gave her name at the reception desk and settled into a chair, trying to breathe deeply, as she'd once learned at a stress-reduction seminar. After a few minutes, she took the novel she'd been reading on the bus out of her small leather purse. Anita Brookner's deliberate prose seemed especially welcome at this moment. She read a few pages and started to feel calmer.<br><br>"I told you to get out," the man hissed in her ear. Helen stopped breathing. How could she still hear his voice, the same one she'd heard outside in the street? It must be her memory playing tricks on her, replaying something he'd already said. She shook her head, as if to dislodge the thought. "Hey, cunt, I'm talkin' to you," the voice whispered. Helen jumped up. Her eyes darted to the waiting patients. Had one of them spoken? Had they heard the man? They all seemed occupied, as before. No one even glanced up. Helen crumpled into her chair. She felt odd, as if she were in an episode of The Twilight Zone, simultaneously in two worlds. Nothing this strange had ever happened to her. She was pragmatic and sensible, hardly someone given to experiences of the occult.<br><br>"Helen Chadwick." Suddenly Dr. Thomas was beckoning to her from the reception desk. Helen tucked the book back into her purse and slowly stood up. The doctor nodded and set off briskly for her office, two floors above. She was halfway up the stairs before Helen had taken her first step. "You got one more minute, you stupid cunt, to get out of here," the man screamed. Overcome with fright, Helen bolted to the door and shot outside. She was almost to the corner by the time a sweating Dr. Thomas caught up with her.<br><br>"What's going on?" the doctor asked.<br><br>"Someone told me to leave," Helen mumbled.<br><br>"What? That's nonsense. Come back to the office," said Dr. Thomas, gently steering them both toward the house. Helen numbly did as she was told, just as she'd done with the screaming man. Everyone seemed to be ordering her about. She felt frightened, at the mercy of unknown forces. They were all so insistent that she couldn't refuse their demands.<br><br>"Are you all right? What happened? Were you hearing voices?" she heard Dr. Thomas ask from somewhere far off. Although she didn't work as a psychiatrist, Dr. Thomas had trained in the field, so she knew more about mental illness than the average GP. Helen felt as if she were in a tunnel. Sounds were tinny and there was an echo, distorting the words. "No," she murmured as a voice bellowed, "Don't tell her anything!"<br><br>Later, waking confusedly as afternoon sunlight streamed into her bedroom, Helen tried to work out what had happened. Had she been having one of those vivid nightmares, the kind that seem real even after you wake up? But why would she be sleeping in the daytime instead of being at the office? Then she caught sight of the bottle of pills Dr. Thomas had given her and realized with horror that the events of the morning had indeed occurred. What if those dreadful voices started up again? A terrifying thought. Was the stress at work getting to her? Did she have a brain tumor? An article she'd recently read about people with brain cancers had mentioned hallucinations as a symptom. Maybe she had some terrible neurological ailment. Or, even more frightening, what if she were cracking up? A colleague at work who'd studied psychology once remarked that nervous breakdowns can happen to anyone.<br><br>Not wanting to tempt fate, that evening Helen didn't say a word to her partner about her trip to the doctor. "I thought it was better to keep the whole bizarre experience secret," she told me later. "Talking about it might only bring it back or make me more frightened."<br><br>Helen didn't return the next week for the follow-up appointment Dr. Thomas had scheduled. For four months, she didn't tell anyone what was happening inside her head. The voices came and went--appearing several times in a day or mercifully being absent for a week or more. Sometimes it was the man alone; sometimes the woman joined him, or there was another man whose accent was Scottish. Their language was filthy. Helen had never heard anyone speak words like that aloud. She couldn't even repeat them to herself; telling anyone else about them seemed unimaginably mortifying.<br><br>But keeping the secret took its toll. Struggling not to respond outwardly to the voices or even to give any sign of hearing them when others were present exhausted her. It became harder and harder to concentrate on any task. Helen began avoiding friends and gave vague reasons for not going to work. On particularly bad days, she couldn't tell the difference between the voices in her head and those of her colleagues. Being out in the street was particularly distressing; she could never tell whether the voices she heard were inside or coming from people nearby. Sometimes, accosted by a voice while in a shop, she would panic and run away, even in the middle of a transaction.<br><br>At home, her partner found her increasingly distracted and withdrawn. When guests came for dinner, Helen rarely spoke, and often she looked from one to another as if she couldn't follow the conversation. She started refusing to watch her favorite TV shows; if she happened to walk through the room when someone else was watching television, she stared at it intently, as if trying to work out its purpose.<br><br>In September, four months after her original visit to Dr. Thomas, Helen Chadwick signed herself into a mental hospital at the urging of her distraught and mystified partner. Dr. Krishnan, the psychiatrist assigned to her case, barraged her with questions. "Where are you? What day is it? Who is the prime minister? Do you have headaches? Problems eating? Night sweats? Double vision? Do you hear voices?" As soon as she mumbled yes to that last one, he ended the intake interview and she was prescribed Haldol, an antipsychotic medication. It had a slight dampening effect on the voices, making them sound as if they were coming from a long metal tube. But they made her so dopey she could barely shuffle from the toilet to the dayroom. Besides, the voices were still there. The drug made it impossible for Helen to read or follow the action in even the simplest TV show, so the net effect of the treatment was that the voices were more of a torment. They might be fainter, but now there weren't any ways to escape from them.<br><br>After a few weeks, Helen stopped thinking that the voices might be real people speaking to her from some unseen place. She knew they were in her mind, but this "knowing" was theoretical, like knowing the earth is round. It doesn't look round. The voices didn't seem like they were inside her; they sounded as though they were coming from across the room or down the street. She heard them through her ears; they were nothing like thoughts or talking to herself. And because they didn't sound remotely like her, because they constantly said words she never uttered, it was difficult to conceive of them as her creation.<br><br>Helen Chadwick's first hospitalization lasted more than a year. Neither the medication nor the electroshock treatment she was given made the voices disappear. Removed from her job on grounds of disability, she spent most of her time tormented by the demands of screaming people inside her head. Helen could no longer travel into Central London on the Underground; one of the male voices kept daring her to jump onto the tracks as a train approached. If she went for a walk in her neighborhood, the shrill woman urged her to dart into traffic at busy intersections. For much of the past decade, Helen's life has been a nightmare of fear and persecution from people others can't hear.<br><br>Yet compared to many mental patients, she is fortunate: Her partner of more than thirty years has loyally stood by her, and Helen lives in Britain, the worldwide center of the Hearing Voices Network (HVN).<br><br>TRADITIONAL PSYCHIATRIC VIEWS CLASSIFY VOICE HEARING as an "auditory hallucination," a neurological event that is invariably pathological and should be stopped if possible. An underlying disease process like schizophrenia is assumed to cause this kind of brain dysfunction. Asking a patient about the speakers or the content of the voices is seen by most psychiatrists as dangerous or useless, a way of "colluding" with the illness that can't possibly help the patient. Aside from asking the few questions necessary to determine that the experience is taking place, physicians rarely talk to patients about their voices.<br><br>"For the seventeen years that I was treated unsuccessfully for 'auditory hallucinations,'" one patient commented recently, "my psychiatrists seemed to view my voice hearing experience as nothing but the random fluctuation of neurotransmitters in my brain. No one ever asked me about it." Having turned to physicians for help in understanding these confusing or frightening mental states, patients often find their doctors' lack of interest perplexing. Simply being told to take their medication and ignore what's happening in their minds makes them feel more alone and strange. And those for whom the medications don't work at all--a sizable percentage-- feel frustrated by their physicians' insistence that they keep taking them anyway.<br><br>NEW YORK CITY, 2002<br><br>ON A SUBWAY TRAIN IN MANHATTAN, the voice of a woman announces every stop, and then a man's baritone booms out, "Stand clear of the closing doors, please!" Two men near me murmur quietly in Spanish; a mother scolds her whiny child in the seat opposite. I am alone, so nothing distracts me from what all these voices are saying. They surround me. I find this exhilarating. It's one of the things I love most about big cities.<br><br>The voices I'm hearing are nothing like Helen Chadwick's or the ones in Welcome, Silence, the book I'm reading. It's the story of a woman named Carol North, who was tormented for years by people who taunted and threatened her. No one else could hear the people Carol heard in the way everyone in this subway car can hear the voices I'm listening to. And hers certainly weren't exhilarating; they terrified her. They criticized everything she did, gave ominous warnings, and never stopped harassing her. She couldn't just walk away to stop hearing them, the way I can with the voices on this train. Carol North's voices tortured her day and night--at school, in bed, while walking down the street. They were unrelenting and everywhere.<br><br>They began when she was six years old and turned her ordinary life in a midwestern American town into a frightening test of endurance. She could barely hear her teachers over the din inside her head. Nights brought hours of cowering under the sheets to avoid their attacks and threats. Carol also had horrifying images. The birds she passed on her walk to school seemed to be dive-bombing her. She saw fires burning in her house; "interference patterns" swirled in the air around her.<br><br>At first, Carol's terrors attracted the attention of her parents and pediatrician. But because she was so young, and because she'd always been a "sensitive" and unusually imaginative child, her doctor dismissed her voices and visions as "attention seeking." He told her parents to ignore them and reward her for behaving "normally." Carol learned to lie about how she was feeling, and she made it through school on sheer determination.</p><h2>The Illustrated Field Guide to Vintage Trailers</h2><p><p><i>A complete, illustrated A-to-Z resource for vintage trailer enthusiasts.</i></p> <p><i>The Illustrated Field Guide to Vintage Trailers</i> is a complete alphabet of trailers filled with hundreds of high-quality photos and detailed illustrations that make it a one-stop identification reference.

Are you ashamed of the kind of Christian life you live? Have you failed so terribly in your striving for victory that you cry out, &#34;Wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me . . . ?&#34; (Rom. 7.24) Be assured that your salvation is at hand: &#34;thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord&#34; (v.25). For the life that wins is not attained, but obtained. It is not a life changed, but rather a life exchanged. It is not suppression, only expression. It is frankly not in you yourself, because it is in Christ who lives in you. The life which God gives and you receive at the time you believe in His Son Jesus Christ is such a life. It is a life that overcomes sin, provides intimate communion with God, and is full of satisfaction and power. It is already in you, waiting to be explored by you. The secret towards experiencing its power is to let go of yourself and let Christ live instead of you. This requires a childlike faith. Then shall you more than conquer through Him who loves you. In order to help believers into enjoying this life that wins, Watchman Nee delivered a series of messages on this subject at a conference held in Shanghai, China, in the months of September and October, 1935. He dealt with the full range of this important subject in his usual thoroughness yet simplicity and directness. At that conference, the author began with the believer&#39;s personal experience which, shamefully, is much less than desired. Then, by contrast, he described the kind of Christian life as ordained by God. Next, he dealt with the nature of this life that wins before he showed the way of entering into it. In more detail, he treated the matters of yielding and believing, which are the conditions for crossing the threshold of victory. But the author of these messages then warned his audience of the testing of faith which must follow. He exhorted believers to grow in the grace of Jesus Christ. He stressed also the need for having the note of triumph, which is praise. And finally, he concluded with the first and last act after victory, which is consecration. These messages are now being translated from the Chinese for the first time and presented to the readers in book form. May the Lord of glory be glorified through His life being lived out in His own.</p><p>Text: English, Chinese (translation)</p><h2>Japan 1941: Countdown to Infamy</h2><p><p><b>A <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> Best Nonfiction Book of the Year<br><br></b>A groundbreaking history that considers the attack on Pearl Harbor from the Japanese perspective and is certain to revolutionize how we think of the war in the Pacific.<br><br>When Japan attacked the United States in 1941, its leaders, in large part, understood they were entering a war they were almost certain to lose. In a groundbreaking history that considers Pearl Harbor from the Japanese perspective, certain to revolutionize how we think of the war in the Pacific, Eri Hotta poses essential questions overlooked for the last seventy years: Why did these men&#x2014;military men, civilian politicians, diplomats, the emperor&#x2014;put their country and its citizens in harm's way? Why did they make a decision that was doomed from the start? Introducing us to the doubters, bluffers, and schemers who led their nation into this conflagration, Hotta brilliantly shows us a hidden Japan&#x2014;eager to avoid war but fraught with tensions with the West, deluded by reckless militarism, tempted by the gambler&#x2019;s dream of scoring the biggest win against impossible odds and nearly escaping disaster before it finally proved inevitable.</p></p><p><p>Eri Hotta, born in Tokyo and educated in Japan, the U.S., and the U.K., has taught at Oxford, in Tokyo, and in Jerusalem, specializing in international relations.</p><p>PROLOGUE&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> What a Difference a Day Makes<br>&nbsp;<br>In the early-morning hours of a frosty day, December 8, 1941, the Japanese nation woke to astonishing news. It was announced, shortly after seven, that Japan had &#x201c;entered into a situation of war with the United States and Britain in the Western Pacific before dawn.&#x201d; Though no specifics were given, by then the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, on Oahu, had been successfully attacked&#x2014;the first wave of planes was dispatched at 1:30 a.m., Japanese time, and the surprise operation was completed by 5:30 a.m. When news of the attack arrived at 11:30 a.m., the nation was electrified. This was soon followed by Japan&#x2019;s formal declaration of war on the Allies and the report of its further military successes in British Malaya and Hong Kong. (The Malayan operation actually preceded the Pacific offensive by almost two hours.) Throughout the day, the public broadcasting network, NHK, aired twelve special news reports in addition to six regularly scheduled ones for the millions of Japanese glued to their radios.<br><br>On what, because of the time difference, had been December 7 in Hawaii, the air force division of the Imperial Japanese Navy had sunk or damaged numerous ships, aircraft, and military facilities. About twentyfour hundred people were killed in the raid or died shortly afterward from their injuries. The devastating attack was carried out without a formal termination of diplomatic relations by Japan, let alone a declaration of war, a heavy, infamous legacy for the nation. But such tactical details did not interest ordinary Japanese citizens on December 8. The immediate public&nbsp;reaction was one of celebration.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Japan sent planes to attack Pearl Harbor, it was mired in economic and political uncertainties. A sense of helplessness pervaded its population as the state took more and more control of public life. From the beginning of Japan&#x2019;s war with China in mid-1937, its people were led to believe a swift, decisive victory was imminent. Despite all the announcements of Japanese victories in China, however, the Guomindang (a.k.a. Kuomintang, frequently referred to as the Nationalist Party) leader Chiang Kai-shek was not about to give up. Similar to Napoleon&#x2019;s army in Russia, the Japanese forces were drawn far too deep into harsh, unfamiliar terrain to carry out an effective operation. The jingoistic tone of Japan&#x2019;s media coverage continued regardless, but people were privately beginning to question why the war had not ended. Though largely ignorant of the true state of Japanese diplomacy, they had been told that Nomura Kichisaburo, a navy admiral and former foreign minister, had been dispatched to Washington, D.C., in early 1941 to negotiate a peaceful solution to Japan&#x2019;s international isolation. But no good news was forthcoming, and its absence made people fearful. Many knew the United States was upset over recent Japanese initiatives&#x2014;such as allying with Hitler&#x2019;s Germany and Mussolini&#x2019;s Italy and occupying first northern and then southern French Indochina&#x2014;and seemed intent, unless a diplomatic settlement could be reached soon, on crippling Japan with economic sanctions.<br><br> In everyday life, luxury goods had quickly disappeared, and there was a shortage of food, most noticeably the main staple, rice. As the conflict in China went on and on, those remaining in the countryside&#x2014;the best men had gone to the military and war-related industries&#x2014;faced increased pressure to produce more food for the troops. Starting in the summer of<br> 1940, even the fanciest restaurants in Tokyo resorted to serving cheaper imported rice&#x2014;the drier kind some scornfully called &#x201c;mouse poops&#x201d;&#x2014; mixed with potatoes. After April 1941, in six major metropolitan cities once replete with all the conveniences of modern life, people could obtain rice only with ration coupons. By December 1941, this system applied to<br> 99 percent of Japan. In a country where domestically grown rice occupied an exalted, almost sacred place in the national diet, this was seen as a scandalous hardship.<br><br> Life was becoming monochromatic&#x2014;or &#x201c;grave yard&#x2013;ish,&#x201d; in the words of a contemporary observer. Fashionable men and women, who until recently dressed in colorful kimonos or the latest Western-style clothes and spent&nbsp;their time in cinemas and dance halls, now tried to look as inconspicuous&nbsp;as possible. The novelist Nagai Kafu (known as Kafu), an aging bohemian chronicler of urban life who felt as much at home in the opium dens of New York &#x2019;s Chinatown and the caf�s of Montmartre as he did in the raffish parts of old Tokyo, deplored those changes. A tall, scrawny man, Kafu did not strike one as a fussy dresser. He actually knew and cared a lot about fashion&#x2014;a remnant of his high-bourgeois upbringing&#x2014;though he made sure not to look too perfect in his well-tailored European suits. But he felt the recent Japanese inattention to keeping up appearances had gone too far, even for his unorthodox taste. In the autumn of 1940, the sixtyyear-old complained in his diary:<br> &nbsp;<br> The townscape [of central Tokyo] belies its prosperity of only half a year ago. There are no activities and it is all quiet. Around 6:00 p.m., it fills with crowds of commuters just as before. But the clothes that those men and women are wearing! To say that they have become subdued is an understatement. They have become old-mannish and dowdy. Women do not seem to care what they look like anymore, not bothering to put on any makeup. The street does not get lit at night, so people hurry home. Those people who squeeze themselves into the trains, shoving one another, look like refugees.<br> &nbsp;<br> The deglamorization of city life signified the resounding triumph of a publicity campaign to promote nationwide austerity&#x2014;prompted by the prolongation of Japanese military engagement in China&#x2014;that started in the summer of 1940. Fifteen hundred signs bearing slogans such as &#x201c;A True Japanese Cannot Afford to Be Indulgent&#x201d; and &#x201c;Luxury Is the Enemy&#x201d; (<i>Zeitaku wa Tekida</i>) were put up all over Tokyo (though the insertion of one syllable by a graffitist often turned the latter phrase into &#x201c;Luxury Is Wonderful&#x201d; [<i>Zeitaku wa Su-Tekida</i>]).<br><br>Volunteers from patriotic women&#x2019;s associations took to the streets, leading this campaign. These righteous women admonished those who, in their vigilant eyes, wore the kind of lavish clothes they themselves had given up, and they handed out note cards asking them to &#x201c;please exercise self-restraint.&#x201d; Women who wore permed hairdos, rings, nail polish, lipstick, or gold-rimmed glasses were also targeted because they were seen as endorsing a &#x201c;corrupt&#x201d; and &#x201c;individualistic&#x201d; Western lifestyle. There was some angry resistance to this type of witch-hunting. One woman was spotted crying and shouting hysterically, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stand this!&#x201d; A young man strutted down the street wearing makeup, daring the patriotic fashion police: &#x201c;Well, aren&#x2019;t you going to say something?&#x201d; But these were very small acts of defiance in the larger scheme of things.<br><br>Department stores, once places where dreams were sold, came under strict surveillance, too. Every store was told to enforce a one-item-percustomer policy to discourage excessive spending, which was deemed disrespectful of the general austerity efforts. In 1935, the cosmetics company Shiseido began having beautifully presented &#x201c;service girls&#x201d; give free makeup lessons to customers at its department store counters, increasing sales of its beauty lotion twenty-three-fold within two years. But as the China War dragged on, &#x201c;wartime care packages&#x201d; replaced cosmetics as top-selling products. These packages, filled with little snacks, handkerchiefs, pencils, and notepads, were sent to soldiers at the front as a show of moral support from home.<br><br> On the evening of October 31, 1940, the night before dance halls and jazz performances were to become illegal (they, too, were thought to undermine people&#x2019;s sense of morality and public order), every hall was packed with men and women having one last, desperate fling. They crowded the dance floors like &#x201c;new potatoes being boiled up in a pot, constantly bumping into one another,&#x201d; as the metropolitan newspaper <i>Asahi </i>reported the following day. In fact, only women who were professional dancers had been allowed in dance halls since mid-1938, and their numbers had declined by half, having been pressured to join women&#x2019;s associations, which competed with one another for recruits and urged new members to take up more &#x201c;respectable&#x201d; (but much less profitable) jobs as typists and factory workers. But that evening, even after the bands had finished playing the farewell song of &#x201c;Auld Lang Syne,&#x201d; the men and women refused to leave the dance floors, as if to defy&#x2014;again, in a very small, too small, way&#x2014;the coming of Japan&#x2019;s long journey into night.<br><br>But December 8, 1941, changed everything. The gloom of the national impasse that had arisen over the past couple of years turned almost instantly into euphoria as most Japanese cheered the successful attack. A man who was a second grader at the time of the attack, whose father owned a radio shop in Tokyo, recalled his surprise at the sight of a long line forming in front of his father&#x2019;s store. People were waiting to get their radio sets repaired, in anticipation of more special government announcements. He never saw his father do so much business in one day before or after.<br><br>There was very little of the famous Japanese reserve. Strangers con-ratulated each other on the street. Others gathered at the public square&nbsp;outside the Imperial Palace in the heart of Tokyo, falling to the ground and thanking the emperor for his divine guidance of their nation. Aboard an overcrowded train that evening, the diarist Kafu detachedly observed &#x201c;a fellow making speeches in shrill voice,&#x201d; apparently unable to contain his excitement over the day&#x2019;s news. This outpouring of emotion stood in stark contrast to the many contrived victory celebrations orchestrated by the government over the previous few years in an effort to rouse support for its lingering war in China.<br><br> Men of letters were not immune to the Pearl Harbor spell. One of the most distinguished poets of twentieth-century Japan, Saito Mokichi, fiftynine at the time, recorded in his diary: &#x201c;The red blood of my old age is now bursting with life! . . . Hawaii has been attacked!&#x201d; The thirty-six-yearold novelist Ito Sei wrote in his journal: &#x201c;A fine deed. The Japanese tactic wonderfully resembles the one employed in the Russo-Japanese War.&#x201d; Indeed, that war started with Japan&#x2019;s surprise attack on Russian ships in Port Arthur on February 8, 1904, two days before Japan&#x2019;s formal declaration of war. Japan won that war.<br><br>Even those Japanese who had previously disapproved of their country&#x2019;s expansionism in Asia were excited by Japan&#x2019;s war with the West. In an instant, the official claim, gradually adopted by the Japanese government over the preceding decade, of liberating Asia from Western encroachment gained legitimacy in their eyes. Until then, the innately self-contradictory nature of fighting an anti-imperialist war for Asia against fellow Asians in China had tormented them. Takeuchi Yoshimi, a thirty-one-year-old Sinologist, now said he and his friends had been mistaken in doubting their leaders&#x2019; true intentions:<br> &nbsp;<br> Until this very moment, we feared that Japan, hiding behind the beautiful slogan of &#x201c;Building East Asia,&#x201d; was bullying the weak. [But now we realize that] our Japan was not afraid of the powerful after all. . . . Let us together fight this difficult war.<br> &nbsp;<br> Despite the celebratory mood that dominated the country on December 8, there were still people with cool minds and hearts who were doubtful about, if not dismayed by, Japan&#x2019;s new war. Private sentiments also often differed substantially from the pubic outbursts of joy. Many were simply tired of war and its restrictions on daily life. Others seriously worried about their loved ones having to fight.<br><br>A nine-year-old in a rice-growing village forty-five miles (seventy-two&nbsp;kilometers) northeast of Tokyo learned of the Pearl Harbor attack when he came home from school. His mother had been waiting for him outside their house. She cried and said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re at war.&#x201d; Those were no tears of joy; rather, she was anxious for the lives of her six older sons. If this war was to be anything like the China War, who knew how long it would go on, and the new war might even take her youngest away. The boy was struck by the vivid contrast between the deep sadness of families all over his village and the upbeat voice coming out of the radio.<br><br>The&nbsp; small &nbsp;number &nbsp;of Japanese &nbsp;with &nbsp;substantial &nbsp;knowledge &nbsp;of the West could not celebrate, either. They were too aware of Japan&#x2019;s limited resources and were convinced that the country would be annihilated in the end. A young man working for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Nagoya recalled a strange combination of exhilaration and fear upon hearing the radio announcement at work. Though he felt a certain satisfaction over the successful attack on Pearl Harbor, he was afraid of what awaited Japan in the long term. His workplace, dedicated to the manufacturing of the Zero fighter plane, would become a prime target of U.S. bombing in a few years&#x2019; time. Most of his colleagues perished, and he would barely escape death himself.<br><br>But to voice such concerns in the midst of post&#x2013;Pearl Harbor excitement was to risk arrest for insufficient patriotism. A great tidal wave of enthusiasm following victories in the Pacific and Southeast Asia was felt by most Japanese. They were able to forget, at least for the moment, the immensity of the task that lay ahead.<br> &nbsp;<br> On the other side of the Pacific, Pearl Harbor had stimulated an equally pervasive and patriotic response. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress in a measured but determined voice: &#x201c;Yesterday, December 7, 1941&#x2014;a date which will live in infamy&#x2014;the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.&#x201d; Roosevelt&#x2019;s cabinet, led by Secretary of State Cordell Hull, initially urged the president to present to Congress a comprehensive history of Japan&#x2019;s international misconduct. Roosevelt decided instead on an accessible five-hundred-word speech so that his message would get through to as many people as possible: The Japanese attack was treacherous, and the United States had to defeat this cowardly enemy, no matter what it took.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The presidential tactic to stir his nation&#x2019;s deepest emotions against Japan succeeded. The isolationist opposition with which Roosevelt had been struggling over his desire to take the United States into the European theater of war was nowhere to be seen, and his request for a declaration of war was immediately approved, with just one dissenting vote, cast by Jeannette Rankin, a pacifist Republican from Montana. From that historic moment on, Pearl Harbor was etched in the American psyche, reinforced by the powerful battle cry memorialized in the hit song &#x201c;Remember Pearl Harbor.&#x201d; Recorded within ten days of the attack, it urged Americans: &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s remember Pearl Harbor as we go to meet the foe. Let&#x2019;s remember Pearl Harbor as we did the Al...</p></p><h2>Omega Men: The End Is Here</h2><p>From one of the hottest writers in the industry, TOM KING (BATMAN, GRAYSON) and artist BARNABY BAGENDA (A1) comes the critically acclaimed, #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestseller OMEGA MEN: THE END IS HERE&#x2014;a revolutionary new take on the classic DC space opera. <br> &nbsp;<br> Named A.V.

And yet, for many of us, getting God&#x2019;s love from our heads to our hearts may be the most difficult&#x2014;yet the most important&#x2014;thing we ever accomplish.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I need to talk,&#x201d; Lisa whispered in my ear one day after women&#x2019;s Bible study. A committed Christian with a deep passion for the Lord, my friend had tears pooling in her dark eyes as we found a quiet corner where we could talk.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s wrong with me,&#x201d; she said, shaking her head as she looked down at her feet. &#x201c;I could go to the worst criminal or a drug addict living on the street, and I could look him in the eye and tell him, &#x2018;Jesus loves you!&#x2019; and mean it from the bottom of my heart.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;But, Joanna,&#x201d; she said, gripping my hand, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t seem to look in the mirror and convince myself.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her words were familiar to me. I&#x2019;d felt that same terrible disconnect early in my walk with the Lord. Hoping He loved me but never really knowing for sure. Sadly, I&#x2019;ve heard the same lonely detachment echoed by hundreds of women I&#x2019;ve talked to around the country. Beautiful women. Plain women. Talented and not-so-talented women. Strong Christian women, deep in the Word and active in their church, as well as women brand new to their faith. Personal attributes or IQs seem to matter little. Whether they were raised in a loving home or an abusive situation, it doesn&#x2019;t seem to change what one friend calls an epidemic among Christian women (and many men as well): a barren heart condition I call love-doubt.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Jesus loves me&#x2014;this I know, for the Bible tells me so.&#x201d;(1) Many of us have sung the song since we were children. But do we really believe it? Or has Christ&#x2019;s love remained more of a fairy tale than a reality we&#x2019;ve experienced for ourselves in the only place we can really know for sure?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hearts.<br><br><b>He Loves Me...He Loves Me Not<br></b><br>You would think after accepting Christ at a young age and being raised in a loving Christian home with a loving, gracious father, I would have been convinced from the beginning that my heavenly Father loved me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me. With all my faults and failures. My silly stubbornness and pride.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But those very things kept me from really knowing Christ&#x2019;s love for the majority of my early adult life. There was just so much to dislike, so much to disapprove of. How could God possibly love me? Even <i>I</i> wasn&#x2019;t that crazy about me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some reason, I&#x2019;d come to see God as distant and somewhat removed. Rather than transposing upon God the model of my earthly father&#x2019;s balanced love&#x2014;both unconditional yet corrective&#x2014;I saw my heavenly Father as a stern teacher with a yardstick in His hand, pacing up and down the classroom of my life as He looked for any and all infractions. Measuring me against what sometimes felt like impossible standards and occasionally slapping me when I failed to make the grade.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, He loved me, I supposed. At least that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;d been taught. But I didn&#x2019;t always feel God&#x2019;s love. Most of the time I lived in fear of the yardstick. Who knew when His judgment would snap down its disapproval, leaving a nasty mark on my heart as well as my soul?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, I lived the first three decades of my life like an insecure adolescent, forever picking daisies and tearing them apart, never stopping to enjoy their beauty. <i>He loves me, He loves me not,</i> I would say subconsciously, plucking a petal as I weighed my behavior and attitudes against what the Bible said I should be.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powerful church services and sweet altar times. Ah, I felt secure in His love. Real life and less-than-sweet responses? I felt lost and all alone. Unfortunately, all I got from constantly questioning God&#x2019;s love was a fearful heart and a pile of torn, wilted petals. My overzealous self-analysis never brought the peace I longed for.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the peace you and I were created for doesn&#x2019;t come from picking daisies. It only comes from a living relationship with a loving God.<br><br><b>The Tale of the Third Follower</b><br><br>I never planned on writing a trilogy about Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, the siblings from Bethany that we meet in Luke&#x2019;s and John&#x2019;s gospels. In fact, when I wrote <i>Having a Mary Heart in a Martha World</i>, I was fairly certain it was the one and only book to be found in those verses. But God surprised me six years later, and <i>Having a Mary Spirit</i> was born.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought that there might be a third book never crossed my mind until I shared an interesting premise with a few friends who are writers. It was a teaching point I&#x2019;d hoped to fit into <i>Having a Mary Spirit</i> but never quite found room.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;We all know Jesus loved Mary,&#x201d; I told my friends. &#x201c;After all, look how she worshiped. And we can even understand how Jesus loved Martha. Look how she served. But what about those of us who don&#x2019;t know where we fit in the heart of God?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question hung in the air before I continued.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;The only thing of significance that Lazarus did was die. And yet when Mary and Martha sent word to Jesus that Lazarus was ill, they said, &#x2018;Lord, the one you <i>love</i> is sick.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow my words seemed to have extra weight as they floated between us. Extra importance. Even I felt their impact.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few moments my friend Wendy broke the silence. &#x201c;That part of the story didn&#x2019;t make it into the book because <i>it is</i> a book.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can&#x2019;t adequately explain what happened when she said those words, except to say it was as though a giant bell began to sound in my soul. Its reverberations sent shock waves through my body as I tried to change the subject.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing is, I didn&#x2019;t <i>want</i> to write about Lazarus. I wanted to write a different book. I was ready to move on, to explore other subjects.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But God wouldn&#x2019;t let me. And so you hold this book in your hands.<br><br><b>A Place to Call Home<br></b><br>We first meet the family from Bethany in Luke 10:38&#x2013;42. Or rather we meet part of the family&#x2014;two followers of Jesus named Martha and Mary.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#x2019;re probably familiar with the story Luke tells. Jesus was on His way to Jerusalem for one of the great Jewish feasts when Martha came out to meet Him with an invitation to dinner. But while Martha opened her home, it was her sister, Mary, who opened her heart. To put the story in a nutshell: Mary worshiped. Martha complained. Jesus rebuked. And lives were changed.(2)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strangely, Luke&#x2019;s account never even mentions Mary and Martha&#x2019;s brother, Lazarus. Perhaps he wasn&#x2019;t home when Martha held her dinner party. Perhaps he was away on business. Or perhaps he was there all the time but no one really noticed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are like that. They have perfected the art of invisibility. Experts at fading into the background, they go out of their way not to attract attention, and when they get noticed, they feel great discomfort.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I have no way of knowing if this was true of Lazarus. Scripture doesn&#x2019;t give any information as to who he was or what he was like&#x2014;only that he lived in Bethany and had two sisters. When we finally meet him, in John 11, it is an odd introduction&#x2014;for it starts with a 911 call that leads to a funeral:<br><br><i>Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair. So the sisters sent word to Jesus, &#x201c;Lord, the one you love is sick.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this, Jesus said, &#x201c;This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God&#x2019;s glory so that God&#x2019;s Son may be glorified through it.&#x201d; Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. Yet when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said to his disciples, &#x201c;Let us go back to Judea.&#x201d;....<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days....<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...&#x201c;Where have you laid him?&#x201d; he asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Come and see, Lord,&#x201d; they replied.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus wept. (John 11:1&#x2013;7, 17, 34&#x2013;35)<br></i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a tender story. A story filled with emotion and dramatic tension. The story of two sisters torn by grief and a Savior who loved them yet chose to tarry.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there is more to it&#x2014;more truths we&#x2019;ll discover as we walk through the forty-four verses John devotes to this tale. For the story of Lazarus is also the story of Jesus&#x2019;s greatest miracle: that of awakening His friend from the dead. (To read the whole story all at once, see Appendix A: &#x201c;The Story.&#x201d;)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you noticed that when Jesus comes on the scene, what seems to be the end is rarely the end? In fact, it&#x2019;s nearly always a new beginning.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mary and Martha didn&#x2019;t know that at the time. And I&#x2019;m prone to forget it as well.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions and disappointments, sorrow and fear tend to block out the bigger picture in situations like the one we see in Bethany. What do we do when God doesn&#x2019;t come through the way we hoped He would? What should we feel when what is dearest to our hearts is suddenly snatched away? How do we reconcile the love of God with the disappointments we face in life?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such questions don&#x2019;t have easy answers. However, in this story of Jesus&#x2019;s three friends, I believe we can find clues to help us navigate the unknown and the tragic when we encounter them in our own lives. Tips to help us live in the <i>mean</i>time&#x2014;that cruel in-between time when we are waiting for God to act&#x2014;as well as insights to help us trust Him when He doesn&#x2019;t seem to be doing anything at all.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most important, I believe the story of Lazarus reveals the scandalous availability of God&#x2019;s love if we will only reach out and accept it. Even when we don&#x2019;t deserve it. Even when life is hard and we don&#x2019;t understand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For God&#x2019;s ways are higher than our ways, and His thoughts are higher than our thoughts, Isaiah 55:8&#x2013;9 tells us. He knows what He&#x2019;s doing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when we can&#x2019;t figure out His math.<br><br><b>Algebra and Me</b><br><br>Arithmetic was always one of my favorite subjects in grade school, one I excelled at. Of course, that was in the last century, before they started introducing algebra in the fourth grade. In my post&#x2013;<i>Leave It to Beaver</i>, yet very serene, childhood, the only equations that wrinkled my nine-year-old forehead were fairly straightforward:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 + 2 = 4<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19 &#x2212; 7 = 12<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, fourth-grade math was more difficult than that. But the basic addition and subtraction skills I&#x2019;d learned in first and second grade helped me tackle the multiplication and division problems of third and fourth grade with confidence. By the time I reached sixth grade, I was fairly proficient with complicated columns of sums and had pretty much conquered the mysterious world of fractions. I was amazing&#x2014;a math whiz.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then eighth grade dawned and, with it, a very brief introduction to algebra. It all seemed quite silly to me. Who cared what the <i>y</i> factor was? And why on earth would I ever need to know what <i>x</i> + <i>y</i> + <i>z</i> equaled?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my teacher gave us a high-school placement math exam that spring, I didn&#x2019;t spend a lot of time trying to figure out the answers&#x2014;mainly because I had no idea how, and when I tried, it made my head hurt. Instead, when I encountered a difficult problem during the test, I did what had always worked for me: I looked for a pattern in the answers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing my mind to back up a bit and my eyes to go a little fuzzy, I&#x2019;d stare at all those little ovals I&#x2019;d so neatly darkened in with my number-two pencil until I could see a pattern. <i>I haven&#x2019;t filled in a D for a while. Or, There were two Bs and then two Cs and one A, so obviously this must be another A.<br></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was amazing at this too.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, really, I was. Several weeks later when we received the results of our testing, I had been placed not in bonehead math, not even in beginning algebra. No, it was accelerated algebra for me, though I hadn&#x2019;t a clue what I was doing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this day I still don&#x2019;t. My algebraic cluelessness has followed me through adulthood and on into parenting. My kids can ask an English question, quiz me on history or government, and I can usually give them an answer or at least help them find one. But when it comes to algebra or geometry or calculus or any of those other advanced math classes invented by some sick, twisted Einstein wannabe...well, they&#x2019;d better go ask their dad.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advanced mathematics remains a complete mystery to me. The unknown factors seem so haphazard. What if <i>z/y</i> squared doesn&#x2019;t equal nine? What then?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unknown factors frustrate us in life&#x2019;s story problems as well&#x2014;and there are plenty of those in John 11. How are we to compute the fact that Jesus stayed where He was rather than rushing to Lazarus&#x2019;s side when He heard His friend was ill? How do we reconcile Jesus&#x2019;s allowing Mary and Martha to walk through so much pain when He could have prevented it in the first place?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Difficult questions, without a doubt. But there is a foundational truth in this passage we must first acknowledge before we can tackle the tougher issues.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Jesus <i>loved</i> Martha and her sister and Lazarus&#x201d; (John 11:5, emphasis added).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus loves you and me as well. He loves us just as we are&#x2014;apart from our Martha works and Mary worship. He even loves those of us who come empty-handed, feeling dead inside and perhaps a little bound.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For while it may not add up in our human calculations, the truth of God&#x2019;s love lies at the heart of the gospel. &#x201c;While we were still sinners,&#x201d; Romans 5:8 tells us, &#x201c;Christ died for us.&#x201d; We may not be able to do the math ourselves or reason out such amazing grace, but if we&#x2019;ll simply ask, our heavenly Father longs to help us find the bottom line.<br><br><b>The Lazarus Factor</b><br><br>I&#x2019;ve always told my husband, John, that he has to die before I do&#x2014;mainly because I don&#x2019;t want him remarrying some wonderful woman and finding out what he&#x2019;s missed all these years. But then again, if he were to go first, I&#x2019;m convinced I&#x2019;d face financial ruin in two months. It&#x2019;s not because John hasn&#x2019;t taken very good care of us financially but because I absolutely hate balancing checkbooks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My idea of reconciling my checking account is to call a very nice lady named Rhonda at our bank. She graciously lets me know the bottom line whenever I&#x2019;m a little leery of where I stand.<br>&amp;nbs...</p><h2>Dinner by Candlelight</h2><p>Christmas Is Coming! Feeling Anxious?

Hunter</b> is the author of the young adult fantasy series Shadow Falls, including <i>Awake at Dawn</i>. She grew up in Alabama, where she caught lightning bugs, ran barefoot, and regularly rescued potential princes, in the form of Alabama bullfrogs, from her brothers. Today, she's still fascinated with lightning bugs, mostly wears shoes, but has turned her focus to rescuing mammals. She now lives in Texas with her four rescued cats, one dog, and a prince of a husband, who for the record, is so not a frog. When she's not writing, she's reading, spending time with her family, or shooting things--with a camera, not a gun.</p><p>C.C. Hunter is a pseudonym. Her real name is Christie Craig and she also writes humorous romantic suspense romance novels.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>"This isn't funny!" her father yelled.</p><p>No, it wasn't, Kylie Galen thought as she leaned into the refrigerator to find something to drink. In fact, it was so not funny she wished she could crawl in beside the mustard and moldy hot dogs, shut the door, and not hear the angry voices spewing from the living room.</p><p>Her parents were at it again.</p><p>Not that it would go on much longer, she thought as the mist of the fridge seeped out the door.</p><p>Today was the day.</p><p>Kylie's throat tightened. She swallowed a lump of raw emotion and refused to cry.</p><p>Today had to be the suckiest day of her life. And she'd had some pretty sucky days lately, too. Acquiring a stalker, Trey breaking up with her, and her parents announcing their divorce&#x201a;��yup, sucky pretty much covered it. It was no wonder her night terrors had returned full force.</p><p>"What have you done with my underwear?" Her father's growl spilled into the kitchen, snuck under the refrigerator door, and bounced around the hot dogs.</p><p><i>His underwear?</i> Kylie pressed a cold diet soda can to her forehead.</p><p>"Why would I do anything with your underwear?" her mother asked in her oh-so-nonchalant voice. That was her mom all right, nonchalant. Cold as ice.</p><p>Kylie's gaze shot out the kitchen window to the patio where she'd seen her mom earlier. There, a pair of her dad's tighty-whities dangled half out of the smoldering grill.</p><p><i>Just great.</i> Her mother had barbecued her father's shorts. That's it. Kylie was never eating anything cooked on that grill again.</p><p>Fighting tears, she shoved the diet soda back on the rack, shut the fridge, and moved into the doorway. Maybe if they saw her, they'd stop acting like juveniles and let her be the kid again.</p><p>Her dad stood in the middle of the room, a pair of underwear clutched in his fist. Her mom sat on the sofa, calmly sipping hot tea.</p><p>"You need psychological help," her father yelled at her mom.</p><p>Two points for her dad, Kylie thought. Her mom did need help. So why was Kylie the one who had to sit on a shrink's sofa two days a week?</p><p>Why was her dad&#x201a;��the man everyone swore Kylie had wrapped around her little finger&#x201a;��going to move out today and leave her behind?</p><p>She didn't blame her dad for wanting to leave her mom, aka the Ice Queen. But why wasn't he taking Kylie with him? Another lump rose in her throat.</p><p>Dad swung around and saw her, then shot back into the bedroom, obviously to pack the rest of his things&#x201a;minus&nbsp;his underwear, which at this moment sent up smoke signals from the backyard grill.</p><p>Kylie stood there, staring at her mom, who sat reading over work files as if it were any other day.</p><p>The framed photographs of Kylie and her father that hung over the sofa caught her attention and tears stung her eyes. The pictures had been taken on their annual father and daughter trips.</p><p>"You've got to do something," Kylie pleaded.</p><p>"Do what?" her mom asked.</p><p>"Change his mind. Tell him you're sorry you grilled his shorts." <i>That you're sorry you've got ice water running through your veins.</i> "I don't give a flip what you do, just don't let him go."</p><p>"You don't understand." And just like that, her mom, void of any emotion, shifted her attention back to her papers.</p><p>Right then, her dad, suitcase in his hand, shot through the living room. Kylie went after him and followed him out the door into Houston's stifling afternoon heat.</p><p>"Take me with you," she begged, not caring if he saw her tears. Maybe the tears would help. There'd been a time when crying got her whatever she wanted from him. "I don't eat much," she sniffled, giving humor a shot.</p><p>He shook his head but, unlike her mom, at least he had emotion in his eyes. "You don't understand."</p><p><i>You don't understand.</i> "Why do y'all always say that? I'm sixteen years old. If I don't understand, then explain it to me. Tell me the big secret and get it over with."</p><p>He stared down at his feet as if this were a test and he'd penned the answers on the toes of his shoes. Sighing, he looked up. "Your mom . . . she needs you."</p><p>"Needs me? Are you kidding? She doesn't even want me." <i>And neither do you.</i> The realization caused Kylie's breath to catch in her lungs. He really didn't want her.</p><p>She wiped a tear from her cheek and that's when she saw him again. Not her dad, but Soldier Dude, aka her very own stalker. Standing across the street, he wore the same army duds as before. He looked as if he'd just walked out of one of those Gulf War movies her mom loved. Only instead of shooting at things or being blown up, he stood frozen in one spot and stared right at Kylie with sad, yet very scary eyes.</p><p>She'd noticed him stalking her a few weeks ago. He'd never spoken to her and she hadn't spoken to him. But the day she pointed him out to her mom, and Mom hadn't seen him . . . well, that's when Kylie's world slid off its axis. Her mom thought she was making it up to get attention, or worse. With the worse being that Kylie was losing her grip on reality. Sure, the night terrors that had tormented her when she was a kid had returned, worse than ever. Her mom said the shrink could help her work through them, but how could she do that when Kylie didn't even remember them? She only knew they were bad. Bad enough to have her wake up screaming.</p><p>Kylie wanted to scream now. Wanted to scream for her dad to turn around and look&#x201a;��to prove that she hadn't lost her mind. At the very least, maybe if her dad actually saw her stalker, her parents would let her off from seeing the shrink. It wasn't fair.</p><p>But life wasn't fair, as her mom had reminded her more than once.</p><p>Nevertheless, when Kylie looked back, he was gone. Not Soldier Dude, but her dad. She turned toward the driveway and saw him shoving his suitcase in the backseat of his red convertible Mustang. Mom had never liked that car, but Dad loved it.</p><p>Kylie ran to the car. "I'll make Grandma talk to Mom. She'll fix . . ." No sooner had the words escaped Kylie's lips than she remembered the other major sucky event she'd had plopped into her life.</p><p>She couldn't run to Grandma to fix her problems anymore. Because Grandma was dead. Gone. The vision of Nana lying cold in the casket filled Kylie's head and another lump crawled up her throat.</p><p>Her dad's expression morphed into parental concern, the same look that had landed Kylie at the shrink's office three weeks ago.</p><p>"I'm fine. I just forgot." Because remembering hurt too much. She felt a lone tear roll down her cheek.</p><p>Dad moved in and hugged her. The embrace lasted even longer than his usual hugs, but it ended too soon. How could she let him go? How could he leave her?</p><p>His arm dropped from around her and he physically set her back. "I'm just a phone call away, Pumpkin."</p><p>Swiping at her tears, hating her watery weakness, she watched her dad's red convertible get smaller as it buzzed down the street. Wanting to be alone in her room, she started to run inside. Then she remembered and looked back across the street to see if Soldier Dude had pulled his usual disappearing act.</p><p>Nope. He was still there, staring, stalking. Scaring the bejeebies out of her and making her angry at the same time. He was the reason she had to see a shrink.</p><p>Then Mrs. Baker, her elderly neighbor, toddled out to get her mail. She smiled at Kylie but not once did the old librarian glance at Soldier Dude taking up residence on her front lawn, even when he stood less than two feet from her.</p><p>Weird.</p><p>So weird it sent an unnatural chill tiptoeing down Kylie's spine, the same kind of chill Kylie had gotten at Nana's funeral.</p><p>What the hell was going on?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Teachers: When Your Teacher Deserves More Than an Apple</h2><p><b>Is it Friday yet?

Then read on! This book is meant to help those who have been named as an executor, for someone who has asked a loved one in to be in charge of their estate or for one who just generally wants to know what the process of closing an estate is all about. It has some technical elements, like how to sell or transfer stock and &#x2013; but the real value of the book is setting expectations. It includes advice such as; making the funeral arrangements, dividing up the jewelry and selling the furniture. More importantly, it gives the first time executor enough information so they can be conversant when talking to lawyers, accounts and beneficiaries. That&#x2019;s the main reason this book is different than others &#x2013; it has more of the practical versus the legalese. It basically helps someone who&#x2019;s never been an executor before or hasn&#x2019;t been exposed to the process and needs a little bit of help to carry out the wishes of a loved one. It&#x2019;s about things like; how long the process will take, fairness with beneficiaries, what curveballs might be thrown your way and what some of the pitfalls that might be encountered. For example, you should be aware that some insurance companies will drop homeowners insurance or not honor the policy if the house is vacant for an extended period of time. Again, that&#x2019;s where the value of this book is, eliminating some of those first time &#x201c;unknowns&#x201d; of being the executor of an estate. There is also a short &#x201c;What should I do if?&#x201d; chapter to answer questions such as; what if someone else wants to be the executor, if someone sues the estate, if the beneficiaries don&#x2019;t want to sign the refunding bonds, etc... In addition to the practical help, this book can help save you some fees when you administer the estate. You can close bank accounts, close insurance policies, transfer stock, send refunding bond notices, and file the will for probate by yourself. All those things are not hard to do, they&#x2019;re mostly administrative in nature and can be handled by a layperson. The idea is to let the lawyers focus on their areas of expertise while you focus on those administrative items.</p><p></p><h2>Vampire Knight, Vol. 19 (19)</h2><p>Cross Academy is attended by two groups of students: the Day Class and the Night Class.

More than any other system in the Apollo spacecraft, the Apollo Guidance Computer drove the capabilities of the lunar missions. In the 1960's, most computers filled an entire room yet the spacecraft's computer was required to be compact and require little power.&nbsp; When compared to modern systems, the AGC's design limitations and lack of speed presented formidable challenges. Yet, hardware and software engineers overcame these difficulties, and their creation was able to guide a new and complex spacecraft and its precious human cargo away from the safety of Earth and towards a new world. Although people today find it difficult to accept that it was possible to control a spacecraft using such a 'primitive' computer, it nevertheless had capabilities that are advanced even by today's standards.<br><br><b>The Apollo Guidance Computer: Architecture and Operation</b> is the first comprehensive description of the Apollo computer, beginning with its internal organization to its user interface and flight software. Particular emphasis is placed on the instruction set, Executive capabilities, the Interpreter and the detailed procedures for mission application software. Launch, landing on the Moon and entry back on Earth are explained in rich detail and show how the computer was an integral part of the spacecraft operation. As a comprehensive account, it spans the disciplines of computer science, aerospace engineering and spacecraft operations. <b>The Apollo Guidance Computer: Architecture and Operation</b> is an essential reference for space historians and engineers, and serves well as a complementary text for computer science courses.</p><p>By today&#39;s standards, the on-board computer used by the Apollo astronaut&#39;s was a primitive affair, but in an age when most computers filled an entire room, this was small, required little power, and incorporated several technologies that were revolutionary for its time. This is the first book to fully describe the Apollo guidance computer&#39;s architecture, Executive software, and the programs used by astronauts. It describes the full range of technologies required in order to fly the Apollo lunar missions, and whicn enabled the astronauts to fly to the Moon - and back!Frank O&#39;Brien&#39;s interest in the Apollo program began as a serious amateur historian. By the early 1990&#39;s, he began performing research and writing essays for the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal, and the Apollo Flight Journal, which are considered the canonical online reference on the flights to the Moon. Much of this work centered on his primary interests, the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) and the Lunar Module. He was then asked to assist the curatorial staff in the creation of the Cradle of Aviation Museum, on Long Island, New York, where he helped prepare the Lunar Module simulator, a LM procedure trainer and an Apollo space suit for display. He regularly lectures on the Apollo computer and related topics to diverse groups, from NASA&#39;s computer engineering conferences, the IEEE/ACM, computer festivals and university student groups.</p><h2>The Toxic Tooth: How a root canal could be making you sick</h2><p><p>Is Your Smile Worth Your Life? What You Need to Know Before Undergoing a Root Canal Undergoing a root canal procedure isn't anyone's idea of a good time, but if one is necessary, we don't question its safety. According to Robert Kulacz, DDS and Thomas E. Levy, MD, JD, we should. Here, they reveal the hidden dangers of root canals. Nobody looks forward to having a root canal. But if you're in constant discomfort because of an infected tooth, you'll willingly hop into the dentist's chair and open wide. Sure, you might worry about feeling pain during the procedure (or paying for it afterward), but beyond those concerns, there's really no reason to worry about undergoing this common outpatient procedure, right? Wrong. Robert Kulacz, DDS and Thomas E. Levy, MD, JD, say that a root canal is actually a scientifically flawed and potentially dangerous procedure. "Instead of solving a problem, root canals introduce a steady stream of dangerous-and even deadly-toxins into your body," says Dr. Levy, co-author along with Dr. Kulacz of The Toxic Tooth: How a root canal could be making you sick. "Root canal-treated teeth are not sterile and contain pathogenic bacteria, which spread throughout the body and can initiate or worsen heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and even cancer."</p></p><p>Robert Kulacz, DDS received his dental degree from New York University College of Dentistry, and he received post-graduate training in implant surgery and implant restoration sponsored by Brookdale Hospital in Brooklyn N.Y. He abandoned much of his traditional dental practice after learning of the risks of some of the dental procedures he was performing. His first book, The Roots of Disease, with co-author Dr. Tom Levy was published in 2002. It introduced many of the concepts that The Toxic Tooth now greatly expands upon.</p><h2>Jimmy Stewart: The Truth Behind the Legend</h2><p>Many stars of the silver screen in twentieth-century Hollywood became national icons, larger-than-life figures held up as paragons of American virtues. However, the private lives of actors such as John Wayne, Henry Fonda, and Errol Flynn rarely lived up to the idealistic roles they portrayed. James Stewart was known as the underdog fighter in many of his films and in real life. He was highly decorated for his bravery as a bomber pilot during World War II and was adored for his earnest and kindly persona. But there was much more to the man.<br><br>In this <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, the many sides of Stewart are revealed: his explosive temper, his complex love affairs and his longstanding marriage, his service as an FBI agent, his innate shyness, and his passionate patriotism. Munn&#x2019;s personal touch shines through his writing, as he was a friend of Stewart and his wife, Gloria, and interviewed them as well as their colleagues and friends. This definitive biography reveals the childhood ups and downs that formed this cinema hero; explores the legendary Fonda-Stewart relationship; and recounts Stewart&#x2019;s experiences making such acclaimed films as <i>The Philadelphia Story</i>, <i>Rear Window</i>, <i>Anatomy of a Murder</i>, <i>It&#x2019;s a Wonderful Life</i>, and <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i>.<br><br>Skyhorse Publishing, along with our Arcade, Good Books, Sports Publishing, and Yucca imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of biographies, autobiographies, and memoirs. Our list includes biographies on well-known historical figures like Benjamin Franklin, Nelson Mandela, and Alexander Graham Bell, as well as villains from history, such as Heinrich Himmler, John Wayne Gacy, and O. J. Simpson. We have also published survivor stories of World War II, memoirs about overcoming adversity, first-hand tales of adventure, and much more. While not every title we publish becomes a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller or a national bestseller, we are committed to books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home.</p><p>Michael Munn is a film historian and the author of twenty-five books, including "Stars at War," "The Hollywood Connection," "Richard Burton," and the bestseller "John Wayne: The Man Behind the Myth." As a journalist, he has written extensively on cinema, crime, ancient history, and World War II. He lives in Suffolk, England. <br>Ask a younger audience about Gary Cooper or Spencer Tracy, and you might get a blank stare. Jimmy Stewart, thanks to It&#x2019;s a Wonderful Life, hasn&#x2019;t suffered the same fate. Stewart&#x2019;s fans are in for a treat with this anecdote-filled biography, which features a major bombshell: for years, Stewart provided undercover reports to the FBI&#x2019;s J. Edgar Hoover. Among the nuggets mined here: the rift over politics between conservative Stewart and his liberal best friend, Henry Fonda; Stewart being tempted by Grace Kelly; and how Stewart wanted to help Hoover rout the Mafia from Hollywood but ended up naming Communists. Unfortunately, these revelations and the text as a whole could have been better documented. Appended is a list of sources, but as Munn, a friend of both Stewart and Stewart&#x2019;s wife, Gloria, testifies, it&#x2019;s limited to &#x201c;who I&#x2019;ve quoted . . . along with the year (as best I can remember it)&#x201d; and the location. Much of the information comes from phone calls and social chats with Gloria Stewart. Did Munn really write everything down? Still, shaky bona fides aside, this a fun Old Hollywood bio. --Ilene Cooper</p><h2>Sensing, Feeling, and Action: The Experiential Anatomy of Body-Mind Centering�</h2><p>"Pioneering movement educator Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen&#x2019;s innovative approach to embodiment, movement analysis and reeducation, Body-Mind Centering, is the subject of this book of collected essays, interviews, and exercises written for Contact Quarterly dance journal between 1980 and 2009. Drawing from both Western and Eastern scientific knowledge, BMC is an experiential study of the body systems and the evolutionary developmental patterns that underlie human movement.

Now in English, Alsanea&#x2019;s tale of the personal struggles of four young upper-class women offers Westerners an unprecedented glimpse into a society often veiled from view. Living in restrictive Riyadh but traveling all over the globe, these modern Saudi women literally and figuratively shed traditional garb as they search for love, fulfillment, and their place somewhere in between Western society and their Islamic home.</p><p><b>Rajaa Alsanea</b>&nbsp;is the author of the novel&nbsp;<i>Girls of Riyadh</i>, which was long-listed for the International Dublin Literary Award. She grew up in Saudi Arabia as one of six siblings in a family of doctors and dentists. Alsanea received her bachelor&#x2019;s degree in endodontics from King Saud University in 2005.This is chick lit with a major difference: It gives us four upper-class Saudi girlfriends who hope for true love and fulfilling marriage just as much as Elizabeth Bennet ever did--but in a very modern cultural setting far more confining as to womens power over their own futures than eighteenth-century England ever was. As social history it is fascinating. The translation from Arabic seems fluent; the author has provided many necessary footnotes explaining cultural semiotics (dress, accents, food, worship) whose import the non-Saudi reader would miss. Kate Reading handles these gracefully, and her Arabic pronunciation is confidence-inspiring. Best, she delivers believable, sympathetic characters and keeps the pot on the boil. This book is an eye-opener. B.G. � AudioFile 2007, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>The Ketogenic Kitchen: Low carb. High fat. Extraordinary health.</h2><p><p>Cancer survivors Domini Kemp and Patricia Daly offer the first comprehensive ketogenic cookbook based on the most exciting new research on nutritional approaches to the prevention and management of cancer.</p> <p>For decades, the ketogenic diet&#x2015;which shifts the body&#x2019;s metabolism from burning glucose to burning fat, lowering blood sugar and insulin and resulting in a metabolic state known as ketosis&#x2015;has been used to successfully manage pediatric epilepsy. More recently, it has been used by the Paleo community as a weight loss strategy.

His cooking celebrates Iceland's pristine ingredients and artisanal producers and has garnered international acclaim. <br><br>JODY EDDY is the author of <i>Come In, We're Closed; North; and Cuba</i>. A graduate of the Institute of Culinary Education in Manhattan, she is the former editor of <i>Art Culinaire</i>.INTRODUCTION&nbsp;<br><br>A Scandinavian winter is a long and frosty affair. It requires fierce resolve to brave the angry winds that gust inland from the ocean; to enjoy a few pale hours of sun before it slips beneath the horizon once more; to thrive in spite of adversity.<br><br>But it&#x2019;s more than a courageous heart and thick woolen socks that see Scandinavians joyfully through the dark, bleak season. Their spirits are enriched and hearts made buoyant by the concept of hygge (&#x201c;hue-guh&#x201d;). It&#x2019;s their winter elixir. It&#x2019;s the notion that taking care of yourself and those you love fortifies you with an invincible sense of well-being that no amount of snow or endless twilight can temper.<br><br>Loosely translated, the word hygge means &#x201c;coziness,&#x201d; but for Scandinavians it means more than creating a warm and inviting space to live. It&#x2019;s about feeling cozy from the inside out and letting this sense of utter contentment permeate everything you encounter throughout the day, gloomy and gray as it may be. The word originated in Denmark, but the concept is fundamental to how all Scandinavian people live every day of the year. It&#x2019;s a concept that feels just right during the winter, but one they also carry into the warmer months, when they spend long summer days hiking in forests and invite friends &#x2019;round for outdoor barbecues under a midnight sun.<br><br>Hygge is about creating a sanctuary of warmth and coziness that acts as a refuge for you and everyone you love. Inviting comforting elements into your day-to-day life is the essence of hygge. Grace,&nbsp;simplicity, and gratitude are the principles hygge practitioners adhere to for an abiding sense of well-being. The Scandinavian spirit overflows with hygge. Drinking hot spiced wine while wrapped in blankets by a glowing fire is hygge. A candlelit meal of warm comfort food with friends is hygge. A summer festival celebrating the longest day of the year with blazing campfires and live music is hygge. Wool socks, aromatic tea, and a good read at a cabin are hygge. A bakery with freshly baked bread is hygge. Bikes are more hygge than cars. Fluorescent lights are never hygge. Relaxing on the couch with a birch schnapps cocktail, your feet kept toasty nestled in the fur of a loving dog, is hygge.<br><br>Ultimately, hygge is meant to be felt. It&#x2019;s the art of creating intimacy and the comforting sense of togetherness in a candlelit room with a fire crackling and cheerful music playing in the background. It&#x2019;s about eschewing an abundance of material possessions for wealth derived from friendship and solidarity. It&#x2019;s about inviting friends for a picnic beside a river glistening in the summertime sun. It&#x2019;s about taking care of your body through exercise that is not viewed as a burden but is enjoyed in the company of friends along a meandering woodland path. It&#x2019;s about reveling in solitary moments spent reading a book while sipping a good cup of tea. Hygge means slowing down to capture a moment and to listen intently to the stories our loved ones have to share. In the springtime, hygge practitioners gather around outdoor tables flooded in sunshine to make merry over homemade sausages and a few rounds of beer.<br><br>The knowing hygge heart is light and gracious. It&#x2019;s filled with the wisdom of lifelong learning and the compounded gratification of tending others, from our tiniest babies to our oldest and frailest elders to our precious planet. It&#x2019;s also about caring for ourselves.<br><br><i>Hyggeligt</i> is the adjectival form of hygge, and the word appears frequently in conversation in a region where, when the grip of winter is strongest, the sun never rises at all. Hygge finds its way into decorating, traveling, entertaining, and cooking. Homes in Scandinavia are decorated to look and feel hyggeligt with soft lighting, natural fibers, warm colors, and cozy blankets and pillows strewn all around.<br><br>It&#x2019;s hyggeligt to road trip with a group of friends instead of traveling alone. Staying in instead of going out is hyggeligt; if you do go out, you go to a place with a hyggeligt vibe where the lights are low, the food is comforting, and the conversations easy and relaxed. Hyggeligt dressing is about relaxed comfort, not sequins or scratchy fabrics.<br><br>There are events that inspire hyggeligt feelings, such as an orchestra playing classical music beneath a canopy of stars, the audience sitting on woolen rugs in hand-knitted socks, cups of hot cocoa in hand. Simple, slow-cooked meals, with flavors and ingredients that remind guests of their favorite childhood memories&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the hygge way to cook. Creating atmosphere with retro tunes&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the hygge way to entertain.<br><br>Hygge is about making time to pause and be grateful, taking a deep breath, turning off your gadgets, and listening to what nature has to tell you. It&#x2019;s about absorbing the laughter of your children and meaningfully listening to the stories our elders want to share with us. There is hygge wisdom to be gained there. It&#x2019;s about self-care and not feeling guilty about it. Loving ourselves is the first step to living the hygge life.<br><br>To truly embody the hygge lifestyle, you need to embrace its principles through each passing season in every aspect of your life. Certainly a relaxed cocktail party or cozy afternoon book club on a winter&#x2019;s day is prime hygge territory, but hygge can be applied to the office, too. The hygge workspace is organized and inviting, free from distractions but rich in inviting atmosphere. It&#x2019;s a place to accomplish meaningful work that gives you a sense of achievement and pride.</p><h2>Night Journeys</h2><p><p>The year is 1768. In eight years, the American Revolution will begin. Newly orphaned, Peter York has been adopted by a deeply religious Quaker fame. Peter chafes under his new guardian's strict and unyielding views and vows to break away. He sees his chance when two runaway indentured servants are reported to be fleeing through his community. If he catches one, there will be a reward -- and freedom. But capturing the runaways leads to consequences -- and choices -- Peter cannot foresee. </p></p><p><p><strong>Avi</strong> is the award-winning author of more than eighty-two books for young readers, ranging from animal fantasy to gripping historical fiction, picture books to young adult novels. <em>Crispin: The Cross of Lead </em>won the Newbery Medal, and <em>The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle </em>and <em>Nothing But the Truth </em>were awarded Newbery Honors.

But what happens when attentiveness becomes domination? In some relationships, the desire to control leads to jealousy, gaslighting, threats, micromanaging--even physical violence. If you or someone you care about are trapped in a web of coercive control, this book provides answers, hope, and a way out. Lisa Aronson Fontes draws on both professional expertise and personal experience to help you:<br><br> *Recognize controlling behaviors of all kinds.<br> *Understand why this destructive pattern occurs.<br> *Determine whether you are in danger and if your partner can change.<br> *Protect yourself and your kids.<br> *Find the support and resources you need.<br> *Take action to improve or end your relationship.<br> *Regain your freedom and independence.</p><p>Lisa Aronson Fontes, PhD, has a doctorate in counseling psychology and has worked in the areas of child abuse, violence against women, and challenging family issues for over 25 years. A professor, researcher, and popular conference speaker, she teaches at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She survived a relationship that included coercive control and stalking."I wish I'd had this book in my youth, when I was the victim of coercion that whittled away at my self-esteem. This book should be in every women's center, police station, and therapist's office. It cuts through the jargon, gets to the heart of the matter, and provides tools of liberation."--Magdalena G�mez, author of <i>Shameless Woman</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "The first comprehensive guide to overcoming coercive control. Dr. Fontes provides simple tools to assess your own or a loved one's relationship and offers practical steps to getting free, illustrated with real-life stories.

A path-breaking work."--Evan Stark, PhD, MSW, Professor Emeritus, Rutgers University School of Public Affairs<br> &nbsp;<br> "Dr. Fontes makes the dynamics of coercive control understandable to everyone. In plain language and with clear examples, she describes the tactics of domineering individuals and their effects on victims. Dr. Fontes is particularly thoughtful about including diverse couples and families. After reading this book, no one will be able to ask, 'Why does she stay?'"--Juan Carlos Are�n, Director, National Latin@ Network for Healthy Families and Communities<br> &nbsp;<br> "This book reveals hidden dimensions behind relationships where one partner is controlled by the other.

Read this book and reclaim your life."--Rabbi Efraim Eisen, marriage, family, and child therapist, Amherst, Massachusetts<br> &nbsp;<br> "This book is gripping and nuanced. It will be extremely helpful to anyone grappling with issues of coercive control. As a therapist with decades of experience, and a person who has been in coercive relationships, I learned a great deal. The stories of women and men from wide-ranging backgrounds pulled me in deeply. Complex, profound ideas are expressed in easy-to-read language. A 'must-have' resource!"--Janine Roberts, EdD, past president, American Family Therapy Academy<br> &nbsp;<br> "Fontes's writing is clear and vividly illustrated with real-life stories from her decades of work helping abuse victims become survivors. <i>Invisible Chains</i> is a hopeful book that shows a way out of coercive control relationships and illustrates the promise of healing and recovery."--Jeffrey L.

People who work in the legal and criminal justice systems need this book to help keep victims and their children safe. The book is easy to read, but in no way simplistic.

Social and religious barriers, serving to draw lines between specific people groups for thousands of years before His arrival, were suddenly in light of His Great Commission transformed. Never would a tax collector, a zealot, and a traditional Jew share a meal together in peace...but following just a short time in Jesus presence, these barriers crumbled. The influence that Christ had on the men in His day has been celebrated for two thousand years. The overlooked question within mainstream Christianity remains to be: What influence did He have upon women, and what statements did His words and actions make in relation to gender equality? Is it possible that while Jesus Christ, Himself, recognized appropriate gender roles, He also intentionally began the first Women s Liberation Movement? As sensational as this may sound, the proof is in the Word of God, and in the proper contextual analysis of it. IN THE HANDMAIDEN CONSPIRACY, YOU WILL: Follow the cultural and historic backdrop behind Paul s words in 1 Corinthians and 1 Timothy the trouble verses in relation to the issue of women leadership in the Church and understand more properly what he was responding to when the epistles were written. Observe the Principal of Internal Consistency at play throughout repeated accounts of Scripture openly describing women preaching, teaching, prophesying, and leading with powerful voices in the Body of Christ and Saint Peter s acknowledgment that this very activity, foretold in Joel 2:28, began on the Day of Pentecost. Discover what the original Greek nouns and adjectives meant in Paul s greeting orders, the women that he was both commissioning and commending as fellow ministers of his own circle (Phoebe, Priscilla, Junia, and several others who were suddenly equal to men in ministerial commission), and the misleading translational and interpretational errors that continuously assist in perpetuating an erroneous concept that women should always remain silent in the work of Christ. Reflect upon the women Jesus knew, both from Scripture as well as in person, and the groundbreaking, permanent changes He made regarding their rights, their value, and their role in delivering His message to the world. Revisit and refine some ancient, yet inaccurate, ideas the Body of Christ has had regarding the Bible s most talked-about women, such as Eve, Mary (the mother of Christ), Mary Magdalene, Judge Deborah, Prophetess Huldah, and others. Understand why the prohibition of women as equals in leadership is not only unbiblical, it is actually doing harm to the Church today.</p><p></p><h2>Active Parenting: First Five Years Parent&#39;s Guide</h2><p>This guide teaches practical parenting skills that really work to help you make the most of your child's first five years.

Lou&#x2019;s education includes a Bachelor of Arts degree in business and a Juris doctor degree in law from Michigan State University. Risk management was the major focus of his business degree from MSU. Already as a student, Lou was fascinated by risk, risk evaluation, and the concepts of taking and managing risk. For a career centered in finance analysis and law, he also became a certified public accountant and earned an advanced Master of Laws degree. Lou&#x2019;s work career experiences were multi-dimensional. In law, this included 35 years with Dykema Gossett, a national law firm, as a specialist in corporate and tax law and in representing venture capital businesses. He authored a leading book on corporate law and was selected by his colleagues for all editions of The Best Lawyers in America, which represents about one percent of the nation&#x2019;s lawyers. In business, Lou was a chief executive officer and a director and advisor to several major corporations on business and legal matters. His professional career, especially as a lawyer and a venture capital advisor, often focused on taking high-stakes business risks, managing risk, and making decisions with far-reaching consequences. This part of Lou&#x2019;s life made his several decades as a serious mountain climber a natural extension. And it also explains his perspective and the important purpose that led him to closely examine, analyze, and explain what went wrong on Everest and his experience of being there, based on the facts that matter and not on the sensational and irrelevant. Lou is retired from law and business and lives on the northern shore of Lake Michigan. He remains active with alpine sports and other endurance challenges in the great outdoors.Near the top of Mount Everest, on 10 May 1996, eight climbers died.

This volume presents Gandhi's own clear and consistent vision of that philosophy, which he calls <i>Satyagraha</i> &#x2014; literally, "holding on to the truth." Through Satyagraha, one brings about change by appealing to the reason and conscience of the opponent and puts an end to evil by converting the evil-doer.<br>The book begins with an introductory explanation of Satyagraha, including a description of how it differs from passive resistance and what it has in common with the civil disobedience of Thoreau and non-cooperation in general. It proceeds with detailed discussions of discipline and self-control, including living simply, recognizing the unity of all loving beings, and serving one's neighbors wholeheartedly; the courage and training necessary for the Satyagrahi; successful on-cooperation and civil disobedience; political power and Satyagraha, the development of a non-violent army; the use and effectiveness of such techniques as non-payment of fines and taxes, social boycotts, fasting, sympathetic strikes, and other forms of non-cooperation; women and picketing; and many other topics.<br>Invaluable to ethicists, political philosophers, students, and participants in the ongoing struggle for human rights, this inspiring book is as relevant today as it was when first published half a century ago.</p><p></p><h2>Rocket&#39;s Mighty Words (Oversized Board Book)</h2><p>Learn to read simple words with Rocket, the dog who inspires kids to read and write, in this sturdy big board book for new readers.<br><br>Rocket and his friends from the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling picture books <i>How Rocket Learned to Read</i> and <i>Rocket Writes a Story</i> introduce simple words like n-e-s-t and m-u-d, as well as common sight words.

The first spread is a close-up of Rocket running through the grass. Lowercase, hand-lettered words identify "dog, tail, paw, ear, spot, nose," and "stick." Next, a series of verbs including "wag, dig, melt, run, sniff," and "nap" appear illustrated with the humorous poses fans of the series have come to love-snout in air, tail a blur-Hills knows dogs. Two spreads of a wood-framed blackboard with white-chalk-labeled illustrations are also included. These pictures represent random common objects such as foods, animals, household items, a car, and a robot. One page offers a close-up of the little bird, another has four evocative thumbnails of the dog labeled "mud, wind, snow," and "moon." Another spread introduces opposites with owl "up" and Rocket "down" or his tail the only indication that he is "in" a hollow log as opposed to "out." Lying cozily in the grass, the eager student listens to a story with a pile of books nearby. The final spread, "Small words that will come in handy," is a bit confusing as it features abstract sight words like "also, had, since, about," and "very" that babies or toddlers might not grasp. Still, the signature oil and colored pencil illustrations are colorful and charming, and the message that books and words are important is certainly a worthy one. More than 100 words/concepts are identified for little ones to learn.-Barbara Auerbach, New York City Public Schools&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

A black comics artist from New Orleans, Passmore's work is rooted in his experiences and observations from punk rock and direct-action activism. The apocalyptic wasteland of post-Katrina New Orleans comes to life in fantastic sci-fi wrapping complex ideas in sex jokes and exploding uncomfortable truths through sophisticated analogy."Ben Passmore's slim, 11-page mini-comic is an open letter, written in the second person, consisting of a litany of gentle admonitions for well-meaning but racially tone-deaf white people: "Your black friend hates that you slide into 'black' presentations thoughtlessly. He feels like you're mocking him, but knows that you are totally unaware of this ... Your black friend wishes you would play more than Beyonce. There are more black performers than Beyonce and he's worried you don't know that." That last sentiment is matched to a panel in which a clueless white guy sings along to "Formation," while his black friend shoots a hilariously weary side-eye at the reader.

She lives in Corinth, Vermont.Grade 1-3-- A series of star-spattered night skies done in rich blues and purples gives this introduction to the universe and the practice of astronomy an appealing look. A diverse cast--ancient and modern, adults and children, scientists and amateurs--peer through lenses, or point and smile. Gibbons discusses, in short declarative sentences, the nature of stars and constellations, how to find particular ones and why they seem to move, two kinds of optical telescopes, and how a planetarium works, closing with a simple time line and a page of random star facts. As always, her illustrations are simple and clear, even when labels and lines of text are superimposed, or design constraints limit their size. However, she does take on too many topics for such a basic book. Readers are likely to be confused by incomplete explanations of twinkling and the speed of light, or the moonlike object labelled ``star,'' and her unelaborated claim that there are 88 constellations is a severe oversimplification. Still, this makes a good update for Fradin's Astronomy (Childrens, 1983) and a natural gateway to Franklyn Branley's many books. --John Peters, New York Public Library<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Satan Speaks!</h2><p>The last book of essays by Church of Satan founder LaVey.</p><p></p><h2>Sky of Stone: A Memoir (Coalwood)</h2><p>Homer Hickam won the praise of critics and the devotion of readers with his first two memoirs set in the hardscrabble mining town of Coalwood, West Virginia. <i>The New York Times</i> crowned his first book, the #1 national bestseller <b>October Sky</b>, &#x201c;an eloquent evocation ... a thoroughly charming memoir.&#x201d; And <i>People</i> called <b>The Coalwood Way</b>, Hickam&#x2019;s follow-up to <b>October Sky</b>, &#x201c;a heartwarmer ... truly beautiful and haunting.&#x201d; <br><br>Now Homer Hickam continues his extraordinary story with <b>Sky of Stone</b>, dazzling us with exquisite storytelling as he takes us back to that remarkable small town we first came to know and love in <b>October Sky</b>.<br><br>In the summer of &#x2018;61, Homer &#x201c;Sonny&#x201d; Hickam, a year of college behind him, was dreaming of sandy beaches and rocket ships. But before Sonny could reach the seaside fixer-upper where his mother was spending the summer, a telephone call sends him back to the place he thought he had escaped, the gritty coal-mining town of Coalwood, West Virginia. There, Sonny&#x2019;s father, the mine&#x2019;s superintendent, has been accused of negligence in a man&#x2019;s death&#x2014;and the townspeople are in conflict over the future of the town.<br><br>Sonny&#x2019;s mother, Elsie, has commanded her son to spend the summer in Coalwood to support his father.

For Sonny, so begins a summer of discovery&#x2014;of love, betrayal, and most of all, of a brooding mystery that threatens to destroy his father and his town. <br><br>Cut off from his college funds by his father, Sonny finds himself doing the unimaginable: taking a job as a &#x201c;track-laying man,&#x201d; the toughest in the mine. Moving out to live among the miners, Sonny is soon dazzled by a beautiful older woman who wants to be the mine&#x2019;s first female engineer. <br><br>And as the days of summer grow shorter, Sonny finds himself changing in surprising ways, taking the first real steps toward adulthood.

Two forbidden romances.</i></b><br> <b><i>One shocking twist you won&#x2019;t see coming.</i></b><br><br>Seventeen-year-old Keralie Corrington may seem harmless, but she&#x2019;s, in fact, one of Quadara&#x2019;s most skilled thieves and a liar. Varin, on the other hand, is an honest, upstanding citizen of Quadara&#x2019;s most enlightened region, Eonia. He runs afoul of Keralie when she steals a package from him, putting his life in danger. When Varin attempts to retrieve the package, he and Keralie both find themselves entangled in a conspiracy that leaves all four of Quadara&#x2019;s queens dead. <br><br> With no other choices and on the run from Keralie&#x2019;s former employer, the two decide to join forces, endeavoring to discover who has killed the queens and save their own lives in the process. When their reluctant partnership blooms into a tenuous romance, they must overcome their own dark secrets in hopes of a future together that seemed impossible just days before. But first they have to stay alive and untangle the secrets behind the nation&#x2019;s four dead queens. <br><br> An enthralling fast-paced mystery where competing agendas collide with deadly consequences, <i>Four Dead Queens</i> heralds the arrival of an exciting new YA talent.</p><p>Raised on a diet of Spielberg, Lucas and Disney, Astrid knew she wanted to be surrounded by all things fantastical from a young age. She's spent the last 10 years working in film, animation and television as both an artist and manager. Career highlights include working on James Cameron's <i>Avatar</i>, Steven Spielberg's <i>The Adventures of Tin Tin</i> and <i>Happy Feet 2</i> by George Miller.&nbsp;She's a visual writer and aims to capture the vivid stories that play like movies in her head. When she's not writing, she's painting her favorite fictional characters and obliging her furry overlords, Lilo and Mickey. <br><br><i>Four Dead Queens</i> (Putnam, 26th of February 2019) is her debut novel.<i>Iris</i><br> <i>Queen of Archia</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Rule one: To protect the fertile lands of Archia, the queen must uphold the society&#x2019;s humble but hardworking way of life.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Iris shifted uncomfortably on her throne, rearranging her stiff skirts. The midday sun streamed down from the domed ceiling, hitting the elevated golden dial beneath it. The nation of Quadara was engraved upon the face, with thick ridges representing the walls that divided the land. An amber globe sat in the center of the dial and fractured the sunlight into rays, highlighting hundreds of cursive words etched into the throne room&#x2019;s marble walls. The words reminded each queen, and those who visited court, of the approved transactions between quadrants and the strict rules the queens must abide by. Queenly Law.<br> &nbsp;<br> The four thrones, and their respective queens, sat in a circle around the dial. While the quadrants remained divided, the queens ruled from the same court.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Together, yet apart.<br></i><br> Each looked out upon her section of the circular room, a painted crest to signify where her quadrant began.<br> &nbsp;<br> Iris&#x2019;s next appointment stepped from around the partition that separated court visitors from the queens. She glanced at one of her sister queens, Marguerite, sitting beside her. Marguerite raised an eyebrow in amusement as the man bowed, his nose grazing the polished marble at his feet. He stood upon the Archian crest: a rural island bordered by branches, leaves and flowers with a stag atop a mountain, depicted in bold golden swirls.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now thirty years old, Iris had not seen her homeland of Archia for twelve years. But for as long as she lived, she would never forget the crisp air, the lush forests and rolling hills.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the man straightened, he still wouldn&#x2019;t meet her eyes. A shame, for she had lovely eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My queen,&#x201d; the man&#x2019;s voice trembled.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Good</i>. Iris cultivated fear. A time-consuming but worthwhile pursuit.<br> &nbsp;<br> She knew Archia could easily be perceived as the least formidable of all the quadrants, as Archians mostly kept to themselves, rarely crossing the channel to the mainland due to their general distrust for machinery. They focused on physical work and living good, if somewhat modest, lives.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Speak.&#x201d; Iris waved a hand at the man before her. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have all day.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A trickle of sweat ran down the man&#x2019;s brow and onto the tip of his nose. He didn&#x2019;t wipe it away. Iris twitched her nose in sympathy&#x2014;the only sympathy he&#x2019;d get.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have come here to ask you for power,&#x201d; the man said. She scowled, and he quickly clarified, &#x201c;<i>Electricity</i>&#x2014;we need electricity.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Iris had to remind herself he was the Archian governor, although the title held little authority in her eyes. The queens were the power. No one else.<br> &nbsp;<br> Power was a game, and over the years, Iris had perfected it. &#x201c;<i>Need</i> electricity?&#x201d; Iris leaned forward. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> While the other quadrants had electricity, Archia continued to use only what could be <i>wielded by hand and heart</i>&#x2014;a traditional Archian proverb.<br> &nbsp;<br> Finally, the governor brought a shaking hand to wipe his brow.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Electricity would allow for machines,&#x201d; the governor continued. &#x201c;The workers are struggling to keep up with this year&#x2019;s delivery schedule set by Toria. Please consider, my queen.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She sat back and let out a breathy laugh. &#x201c;You know better than to ask this of me.&#x201d; It was true that Quadara&#x2019;s population continued to grow, and no matter what they&#x2019;d tried, all quadrants other than Archia remained barren.<br> &nbsp;<br> Quadara&#x2019;s divided nation was an ecosystem, each quadrant playing its part. Archia provided crops and natural resources; Eonia developed medicine and technology; Ludia provided art, fashion and entertainment; and Toria arranged imports and exports between the quadrants. And Queenly Law upheld the system.<br> &nbsp;<br> Archia was the nation&#x2019;s only hope. Which was why Iris needed to protect her homeland at all costs. She couldn&#x2019;t risk overharvesting the land with the use of machines. If they destroyed Archia, Quadara would starve.<br> &nbsp;<br> While some might still consider Archia primitive, it was not weak. Not while Iris ruled.<br> &nbsp;<br> The governor&#x2019;s bottom lip jerked outward. &#x201c;I know we are not meant to take technology from other quadrants, but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Then you bore me with this conversation because&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Perhaps you should allow this?&#x201d; Marguerite asked. At forty, she was the eldest and longest-reigning queen, and often the voice of reason. Even though her last appointment for the day had been canceled, she continued to watch court with interest. Like all Torians, her curiosity for other cultures could not be satiated.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>An utter waste of Marguerite&#x2019;s time</i>, Iris thought. She snapped her gaze to her sister queen. &#x201c;This doesn&#x2019;t concern you, Marguerite.&#x201d; Her tone was forgiving, though; meddling was in the Torian queen&#x2019;s nature.<br> &nbsp;<br> Marguerite tucked a graying curl of auburn hair behind her ear. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll remember I asked Corra to have her doctors develop an inoculation to prevent the blood plague from spreading further. Sometimes we must bend the rules, but not break them.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Iris tilted her head to see Corra&#x2019;s braided black hair, tied up in the common Eonist way, her gold crown gleaming against her dark brown skin. But the twenty-five-year-old queen of Eonia did not glance back at the mention of her scientists. Stessa, however, the queen of Ludia, looked over and grimaced, as though Iris was annoying her. She probably was, for everything Iris said or did seemed to annoy the sixteen-year-old queen.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;An entirely different situation,&#x201d; Iris said to Marguerite, ignoring Stessa&#x2019;s glare. &#x201c;The plague threatened to wipe out your people. The inoculation was a one-off intervention; it did not significantly alter your quadrant. Even if I allowed machinery for a short amount of time, how would we return to our old ways? I can&#x2019;t risk it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Marguerite gave her an understanding, but amused, smile, as though she thought Iris was being stubborn for the sake of being stubborn.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Iris said, turning her attention back to the Archian governor. &#x201c;Electricity is not from our quadrant; therefore, we shall never have it. We will not be aided by machines and their automatic witchery.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Iris had seen what technology had done to Eonia, and she would not have the same happen to her quadrant. With their mostly frozen and inhospitable land in the far north of the nation, Eonia had no option but to focus solely on technological advancements, and even genetic alteration, to survive. In turn, they had lost a part of their humanity. Or so Iris thought. She couldn&#x2019;t help but look at Corra once more.<br> &nbsp;<br> Iris did not miss the governor&#x2019;s glance to the string of electrical chandeliers hanging in the four passages that led to the central throne room. Iris knew it appeared as though she enjoyed the pleasures of all the quadrants, but the governor didn&#x2019;t know that Iris still read by candlelight and bathed in the natural warm springs in her private garden rather than use the palace&#x2019;s heated water system. She wasn&#x2019;t about to discuss her hygiene regimen with him.<br> &nbsp;<br> When he failed to respond, Iris raised a brow and asked, &#x201c;Anything further?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The governor shook his head.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Good,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;And if anyone wishes to quarrel with my decision, then they know where to find me. The palace is always open to my people.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> With that, she stood and stepped down from the dais, leaving court to her sister queens.<br> &nbsp;<br> ____________<br> &nbsp;<br> IRIS DECIDED TO SPEND the remainder of the day in her cultivated palace garden. Growing up, she had enjoyed countless hours in the immaculate grounds that surrounded her childhood home. It was there where she had imagined her reign and how she would rule an entire quadrant. Iris had been a solitary child, and while she had thought she&#x2019;d prepared herself to be queen, she had not expected anyone could be capable of influencing her reign.<br> &nbsp;<br> Or her heart.<br> &nbsp;<br> The garden was located in the Archian section of the palace, split in four as the nation itself. The garden sat outside the golden dome, perched on the cliff overlooking the channel toward the neighboring isle of Archia. Long ago, one of her ancestors had demanded access to nature&#x2014;to life. Queenly Law decreed the queens were never to leave the palace&#x2014;for their safety and to ensure they weren&#x2019;t moved by external influences.<br> &nbsp;<br> Iris would never set foot in her quadrant again, never soak in the beauty of Archia or see the stags and deer roam the mountains.<br> &nbsp;<br> She sat back in her wooden settee; it sank into the grass while her black skirt swallowed the frame. She removed her heavy crown and placed it on the table beside her. She tilted her head, enjoying the sunlight on her pale skin. The warm springs bubbled nearby, reminiscent of the gentle brook that trickled not far from her childhood home.<br> &nbsp;<br> This would have to do.<br> &nbsp;<br> Also dictated by Queenly Law, Iris had been raised by adoptive parents outside the palace in the region she would one day rule. But while she&#x2019;d been raised in a humble stone cottage, she&#x2019;d never wanted for anything. She didn&#x2019;t know <i>how </i>to want for things she&#x2019;d never seen, never experienced. She learned all she could about her land, the animals and her people. And Quadara&#x2019;s dark past.<br> &nbsp;<br> Archia had been an untouched refuge from the nation&#x2019;s troubles for hundreds of years; in fact, it wasn&#x2019;t until Toria had built their boats and traveled to the west that the lush island was discovered. The rest of the nation had grown desperate, their natural resources nearly depleted. And there was Archia, ripe for the taking.<br> &nbsp;<br> While the distinct regions had each developed strengths and resources, they shared the same weakness. Jealousy.<br> &nbsp;<br> And so began the Quadrant Wars. They lasted nearly a decade, with thousands of lives lost. During this time, the other regions attempted to conquer Archia. But their plans were foolish. As rearing livestock was foreign to Eonists, Torians grew restless and wanted to discover new lands, and Ludists didn&#x2019;t want to dirty their elaborate outfits by tending to the crops.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then the founding queens of Quadara built the walls to separate the regions, finally ending the Quadrant Wars. The walls provided space to breathe, allowing the quadrants to continue to evolve independently, and harmoniously.<br> &nbsp;<br> Archia was once again safe.<br> &nbsp;<br> Iris left her homeland for the first time on her eighteenth birthday, when she had been informed her mother had died. She sailed across the channel on a Torian vessel toward the palace. She took to her new world and throne without blinking, insisting she attend court minutes after her mother had been laid to rest beneath the palace. That evening she had stayed awake until the early morning, reading books on Archian history and diplomacy. Nothing could shake Iris. Not even the death of her mother.<br> &nbsp;<br> Iris opened her green eyes to the vibrant blue sky&#x2014;enjoying the break from the enduring golden palace. With the palace enclosed by a glass dome, every room, and everything within it, was cast in a golden hue. Even at night, the corridors blurred into a deep amber, as though darkness would not dare caress the queens with inky-black fingers.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Iris looked to the clouds in the sky, she thought of her father. Not the father whose blood she shared&#x2014;a man who&#x2019;d never been identified by her mother&#x2014;but the man who had raised her in Archia. When she was a child, he&#x2019;d told her about the queens above, the deceased queens who lived in the quadrant without borders, watching the relatives they&#x2019;d left behind. When she was alone, she would look to the clouds and share her gravest fears and most wondrous dreams, knowing her secrets were safe with them. Her most loyal confidants.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then she came to the palace and met the queens. They spent every evening together&#x2014;often staying up beyond a &#x201c;respectable&#x201d; hour to discuss their childhood, families and quadrants. Iris was no longer alone.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, she often looked to the sky, but now she spoke to her father, long dead.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Father, I have not wavered,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Queenly Law is, and will always be, paramount. However, there are certain rules that pertain to the queens, to <i>me</i>, that I have come to see as irrelevant over the years.&#x201d; Even speaking the words aloud felt wrong. Iris shook her head. She would need to be stronger, be a woman with an iron backbone. &#x201c;We are the queens. We should be able to change the rules that do not affect the quadrants and the peace we uphold. We should have some control over our own lives.&#x201d; She shook her head. &#x201c;I will continue to fight for Archia and protect all we have, but I want more.&#x201d; She shook her head again, thinking of the governor&#x2019;s request. &#x201c;Not more for Archia, but for me.&#x201d; She hated how weak she sounded.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have a plan.&#x201d; She let out a weighted breath. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been too many years silent. But no longer. Tomorrow things <i>will</i> change. Queenly Law will change. Tomorrow I will&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A bee pricked her throat. An intense bite, followed by a dull ache. Bees, and all other bugs and insects, were supposed to have been eradicated from the garden by a spray.<i> Another wonderful Eonist creation</i>, Iris thought wryly. Iris didn&#x2019;t object to sharing her garden with the creatures that <i>should</i> come with it. But the advisors had insisted it was best, for Iris&#x2019;s safety.<br> &nbsp;<br> A smile appeared on Iris&#x2019;s face; perhaps nature had conquered technology in the end, beating out the spray. She couldn&#x2019;t wait to gloat about her findings to Corra at tonight&#x2019;s evening meal.<br> &nbsp;<br> The bee&#x2019;s sting grew more painful, to the point where Iris was unable to swallow. Saliva pooled in her throat. Was she allergic?<br> &nbsp;<br> She brought a hand up to the bite and found a gaping ridge of skin. When she pulled her hand back, it was darkened with blood. A wail gurgled from her lips.<br> &nbsp;<br> A figure loomed over her, teeth gleaming with menace and delight. A thin knife reflected a slice of sunlight, dripping red.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fury flashed through her as hot blood spilled down her neck. Her arms flung backward, knocking her crown to the floor.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>An outrage!

Cellphone tucked under his ear, Gabe left his mower, headed to the garage. He grabbed the medical backpack and another one of general emergency supplies. <br><br>"Big buck came through the windshield," his father said, "airbags deployed, put the car into a tree. Found her busted phone, along with a spilled purse. Driver's license reads 'Evie Blackwell,' 36, a Springfield address."<br><br>"Heading your way now. Call the Tanners, Delaines, see if she's knocked on a door."<br><br>Gabe tossed the gear into his sheriff-issue truck, reversed out of the drive, turned north. "Six miles of asphalt, not much traffic since the new bridge," he muttered, shook his head. Irritated at himself for being irritated, he liked to think he was as good a sheriff as his father had been. He gave it a beat, hit redial. "Anything, Dad?"<br><br>"No one's seen the victim. They're walking out to the road to check."<br><br>"Not good. She passes the Delaines' place, nothing else till town." He turned on his flashers, added speed to close the distance to the crash. "Describe the blood trail."<br><br>"I'm thinking she's got pressure on a pretty serious wound, multiple drops with every pace. She's walking reasonably straight, heading south."<br><br>"She could be at two miles or four." Gabe thought this Evie Blackwell was probably sitting down somewhere on the side of the road, hopefully still conscious.</p><h2>Living in God&#39;s Two Kingdoms: A Biblical Vision for Christianity and Culture</h2><p><p>Modern movements such as neo-Calvinism, the New Perspective on Paul, and the emerging church have popularized a view of Christianity and culture that calls for the redemption of earthly society and institutions. Many Christians have reflexively embraced this view, enticed by the socially active and engaged faith it produces.</p><p><em>Living in God&#x2019;s Two Kingdoms</em> illustrates how a two-kingdoms model of Christianity and culture affirms much of what is compelling in these transformationist movements while remaining faithful to the whole counsel of Scripture. By focusing on God&#x2019;s response to each kingdom&#x2015;his preservation of the civil society and his redemption of the spiritual kingdom&#x2015;VanDrunen teaches readers how to live faithfully in each sphere.</p><p>Highlighting vital biblical distinctions between honorable and holy tasks, VanDrunen&#x2019;s analysis will challenge Christians to be actively and critically engaged in the culture around them while retaining their identities as sojourners and exiles in this world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>David VanDrunen</strong> (PhD, Loyola University Chicago) is the Robert B.

Strimple Professor of Systematic Theology and Christian Ethics, Westminster Seminary California</p><p>&#x201c;For those interested in a Reformed two-kingdom model, I can think of no better book to start than <em>Living in God&#x2019;s Two Kingdoms</em>. Redemptive-historical in scope, heavenly minded in emphasis, and gentle in tone, David VanDrunen has made a great contribution to the ongoing discussion of the relationship of Christianity and culture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Danny E. Olinger</strong>, General Secretary, Committee on Christian Education of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church</p><p>&#x201c;Any Christian perplexed by the Bible&#x2019;s challenge to live as a dual citizen of God&#x2019;s eternal and temporal kingdoms will find VanDrunen&#x2019;s wise and charitable book an indispensable guide in sorting out the confused thinking that entangles the church today. This succinct and timely alternative to neo-Calvinism&#x2019;s transformationist vision lays the groundwork for a wide-ranging and urgently needed discussion about two-kingdom theology&#x2019;s implications for education, the workplace, and politics.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Richard M. Gamble</strong>, Anna Margaret Ross Alexander Professor of History and Political Science, Hillsdale College</p><p>&#x201c;For some years now, I&#x2019;ve been asking students to read works by Prof. David VanDrunen of Westminster Seminary California. VanDrunen has a gift for recovering themes from the political theology of the Reformation and demonstrating their continuing relevance. In this book, VanDrunen shows that the Reformation&#x2019;s two-kingdoms theology allows Christians to faithfully navigate a course between, on the one hand, investing excessive hope in earthly government or, on the other, retreating from political life into isolationist enclaves. Particularly welcome is his emphasis on the liberty of biblical Christians to reach differing conclusions about how our political engagement might glorify God.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Randy Beck</strong>, Professor of Law, University of Georgia School of Law</p><p>&#x201c;Evangelicals today, including those within the Reformed community, have become annoyed by the competing (and, in a few cases, embarrassingly inadequate) &#x2018;transformationalist&#x2019; programs offered by leading Christian thinkers. With clarity and concision, David VanDrunen has offered an alternative perspective that liberates the Christian conscience to sincerely engage society without relegating the sovereignty of God over &#x2018;every square inch&#x2019; of it. <em>Living in God&#x2019;s Two Kingdoms</em> will certainly stimulate debate and force Christians to reevaluate the relationship between Christ and culture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Ryan McIlhenny</strong>, Assistant Professor of Humanities, Providence Christian College</p><p>&#x201c;The Apostle Peter writes that Christians are God&#x2019;s own people, sojourners and exiles in this age. What does this calling mean for the way in which believers work in their jobs, raise their families, educate their children, and vote at the polls? In <em>Living in God&#x2019;s Two Kingdoms</em>, David VanDrunen addresses these questions and more, offering a robust and reasoned alternative to transformationalist understandings of Christianity and culture. Whether or not readers agree with every argument in <em>Living in God&#x2019;s Two Kingdoms</em>, they will find themselves engaged and challenged to think constructively and biblically about a critical issue in the life of the church. VanDrunen has done a great service to the church in promoting continued reflection on Christianity and culture, and in offering sound practical counsels to Christians eager to serve God in their pilgrimage heavenward.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Guy Prentiss Waters,</strong> James M. Baird Jr. Professor of New Testament, Reformed Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;Over the past century, evangelicals have jumped out of the frying pan of quietism into the fire of worldliness. Taking his cue from Scripture rather than merely responding to cultural trends, David Van Drunen outlines a biblically grounded theology of cultural engagement that reflects both the lordship of Christ over all creation and the special mission and calling of the church. This book, bold and unapologetic, provides some extraordinarily helpful categories for thinking clearly about what it means to live faithfully and wisely in the present age.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>William S.

The daughter of a famous actress and a successful Hollywood agent, she was beautiful, wealthy, and living at the very center of the most privileged life America had to offer. Yet at twenty-three her family was ripped apart. Who could have imagined that this magical life could shatter, so conclusively, so destructively? Brooke Hayward tells the riveting story of how her family went haywire.</p><p>Brooke Hayward lives in New York.1<br>Endings<br><br><i>She had called me late the night before. <br><br></i>Looking back, I recall (or invent?) an urgency to her tone, but really all she'd said was "Can you have breakfast tomorrow?"<br><br>"Hmm. What time? Do you have the proper ingredients?&nbsp; English muffins? Marmalade, et cetera?" We'd never shaken the habit of testing one another. <br><br>"Of course, you spoiled brat. Come at ten, you shall have ginger marmalade from Bloomingdale's, <i>fresh</i> orange juice I shall squeeze personally, boiled eggs&#x2014;your customary five and a half minutes. And of course there will be fascinating conversation."<br><br>"Might I have a clue?" We'd also become adept at approaching each other with oblique, occasionally fake, courtesy.<br><br>Silence, as I'd expected. Then: "Okay, do you have a good gynecologist?"<br><br>My silence. "Of course. What for?"<br><br>"Brooke, listen." She was suddenly singing. "I have never ever been so happy in my life&#x2014;I think I'm pregnant."<br><br>"<i>What</i>?" I was predictably stunned, but less by that possibility than by her confiding in me. "How the hell did you get pregnant?"<br><br>"Oh," she said, giggling, "probably from a toilet seat." <br><br>"Bridget. For God's sake, have you gone mad? I mean, how can you possibly be twenty-one years old and reasonably, one hopes, <i>reasonably</i> intelligent and not have been to a&#x2014;"<br><br>"Brooke, listen." She was positively frenzied with elation. "Listen, it's entirely possible that I want to get married, I'm so in love. Do you hear me? <i>Married</i>!"<br><br>This conversation was moving just out of my reach, like a smoke ring. All I could say was "Yes. I see what you mean about breakfast&#x2014;yes, indeed. Might one ask who the expectant father is? No, never mind."<br><br>"Ten o'clock tomorrow. What's he like, is he nice, does he hurt?" I knew she meant the gynecologist.<br><br>"Yes, no, never mind. Actually he's from India&#x2014;nice blend of exotic and imperturbable. Forget it, go to sleep."<br><br>"Okay, see you in the morning. Farewell." Farewell. Nobody but Bridget ever said goodbye to me like that; all her beginnings and endings where I was concerned were unpredictable, and most of the dialogue in between was enigmatic, a foreign language to any outsider. But for my benefit she talked in her own private shorthand, and what farewell meant was that she wanted me to button up my overcoat and take good care of myself until ten in the morning, because she would miss me in a way that would take far too much sentimental effort to express. I knew what she meant. Often I missed her while we were in the same room together.<br><br>I contemplated the phone for some time. Never had I heard her so oddly gay and forthright; as a matter of fact, we hadn't discussed sex since adolescence. Her entire inner life was secretive and mysterious, and no one dared violate it. She sent out powerful "No Trespassing" signals and I had learned to honor them. It crossed my mind that my sister was drunk.<br>Still, the next morning&#x2014;a warm October day in 1960&#x2014;I stood outside her apartment door, nonplussed by the stack of mail and the furled <i>New York Times</i> propped against it. The door itself was slowly getting on my nerves. It didn't open when I rang the doorbell for the fifth or sixth time. It didn't have a crack underneath big enough for a worthwhile view of the interior, although idiotically I'd got down on my hands and knees and looked anyway. Nor did I have a key to unlock it. Even if she <i>had</i> been drunk the night before, which was unlikely&#x2014;besides, I prided myself on being able to interpret at least her external behavior&#x2014;she would have been incapable of losing track of her invitation; she was a creature of infuriating compulsion, particularly in matters of time and place, always fussing about my lack of regard for either. Ever since she'd moved from her one-room, third-floor apartment (to which I had possessed a key, much used) to the comparative luxury of an apartment one floor higher with an actual separate bedroom and view (of the building across the street), I'd felt vaguely displaced and surly. For the last year, I'd though of that little one-room apartment as mine, an irrational attachment, since I was not exactly homeless. Until a month before, I'd been living not only in a commodious house in Greenwich, Connecticut, but also, during the week, in a <i>pied-�-terre</i> on East Seventy-second Street. My marriage to Michael Thomas, art historian and budding investment banker, so blithely undertaken during undergraduate days at Vassar and Yale, had, when removed from the insular academic atmosphere of New Haven, fallen apart. We were no longer wrapped in cotton wool; I was no longer a child bride. Now that our divorce was final, I'd moved our two small children into New York and into my own spacious apartment on Central Park West. I continued, however, to drop by Bridget's whenever I had five minutes between modeling jobs and interviews. "Just checking out my make-up," I'd announce breezily, or, "Gotta use your phone." The idea of telling my sister I'd really come to see her would never have crossed my mind.<br><br>Her new quarters did have certain advantages: twice the closet space for her warehouses of clothes and shoes, and a fully mirrored bathroom, very handy for looking at oneself from all angles while sitting on the cosmetics-crammed counter and conversing with Bridget submerged in the tub as she tested some new bubble bath. But I had never acquired the same proprietary feelings about this setup. It just didn't have the smell and cozy inconvenience of the old. And now I cursed myself for neglecting to collect the duplicate key she'd had made for me weeks ago. Becoming more and more exasperated with both of us, I rang fiercely four times in a row. Actually I felt like kicking the door. Then I though I heard a sound from where the bedroom ought to be. Of course, it was possible that she might still be asleep. Or, more interesting, asleep with an as yet undisclosed lover. But wouldn't she have left a characteristically humorous note to that effect, right where the bills from Con Ed and Jax were now lying? I began to punch the doorbell to the rhythm of "Yankee Doodle Dandy." During countless afternoon naps when we were young, we'd invented out of boredom what we thought was this highly original game, whereby we would take turns tapping out an unidentified song with our fingernails on the wooden headboards of our twin beds; the object was to determine who was better at guessing it or tapping it, or even choosing it if it was particularly esoteric. We both became fairly skillful, but this time the old signal got no response. I decided that the noise was either imagined or my stomach growling. Fresh orange juice and an English muffin with crisp bacon at Stark's around the corner on Lexington became increasingly crucial. I scribbled her a note and went on down in the elevator, trying to feel philosophical about the whole wasted half-hour. Clearly some matter of extreme urgency was to blame. At this very moment she was certainly racing back to meet me, caught between subways, maybe, wonder of wonders, even springing for a cab. <br><br>I galloped across the lobby toward the heavy glass doors and sunlight. Behind the streamlined reception desk, more appropriate to a luxury liner than an apartment building, was a ruddy-faced doorman.<br><br>"Hi. Did you see my sister go out today?"<br><br>"No, Miss," he answered in a thick brogue, "but then I only come on at eight."<br><br>"Ah." I hesitated with a charming smile. "Well. Tell me something." (I tried Mother's ingratiating imperative.) "Um, what time does the mail get delivered? I mean, to the people in the building?"<br><br>"Oh, Miss, maybe just over half an hour ago."<br><br>"And the newspaper?"<br><br>"Oh, somewhere around six or seven. Just a minute, Miss." He moved to the door to let in an elderly couple with a poodle and a Gristede's shopping bag, then bolted the door open so that all the sounds of the morning spewed in. A battle of simultaneous desires was shaping up; whether to go out or stay and satisfy my curiosity. After some consideration I followed him to the immense tropical plant at the entrance. It was embarrassing&#x2014;even melodramatic&#x2014;to ask for a key to apartment 403, but I did anyway.<br><br>"No problem, Miss. I'll ring Pete and ask him to take you up. He's in the basement."<br><br>"No, no, no, thanks, that's too much trouble." Ridiculous. For instance, what if she had had to meet Bill Francisco, a young director at the Yale Drama School (and romantic interest), for whom she was doing some kind of production work? She had probably left a message on my service. A telephone was clearly indicated. Again, Stark's. Besides, Bridget was so intensely ferocious about her privacy there was no telling what she'd do if she knew I'd go to such lengths to break into her sanctuary. Although Bridget was a year and a half younger, I was afraid of her. "Listen, do me a favor&#x2014;when you see her, tell her I came by and rang but there was no answer and I'll call her later. Okay?"<br><br>He nodded and started to lift his hand, but I was already out the door, feeling infinitely better, and striding toward Lexington.<br><br>By the time I'd downed my O.J., read the paper, checked Belles for a negative on messages, and gone to the ladies room, the grand superstructure of the day had begun to disintegrate. Out of perverseness, I jumped on the subway and went down to a sound stage on Fourth Street to watch the shooting of Kay Doubleday's big strip scene in <i>Mad Dog Coll</i>, a gangster film that can still, to my embarrassment, be seen occasionally on late-night TV. (It was the first movie I'd ever been in; I had many difficult thing to do, like play the violin and get raped by Vincent [Mad Dog] Coll, played by a young actor named John Chandler, who, on completion of the movie, decided to become a priest.) Kay Doubleday was in my class at Lee Strasberg's; it was in the interest of art, I told myself, to watch her prance down a ramp, singing and stripping her heart out. <br><br>I then ate a huge heavy lunch at Moscowitz &amp; Lupowitz with the art director Dick Sylbert. Over coffee, he smoked his pipe and patiently tried to explain the difference between champlev� and cloisonn� enamel. This meandered into a discussion of etching techniques. Having killed the afternoon to m thorough satisfaction, I took a slow but up Madison Avenue in order to read <i>Time </i>magazine. It was an absolutely beautiful four o'clock, the best in months, and when the bus got as afar as Fifty-fourth Street, I decided to disembark, fetch Bridget after first giving her hell, and buy a new pair of shoes. <br><br>About a block away from her building, a strange thing happened. I was seized by what seemed to be a virulent case of the flu. My temperature rose and fell five degrees in as many seconds. Hot underground springs of scalding perspiration seeped out everywhere, and yet I was shaking with cold, frostbitten inside and out. There was nothing reassuring about the pavement under my feet; I couldn't move forward on it. Well, I thought, by way of helpful explanation, I should be getting home anyway. Besides, after the screw-up this morning she owes me the next move; either this is repressed anger or pre-menstrual tension, but in any case how virtuous and rich I shall feel for not having bought a pair of shoes this afternoon.<br><br>I hailed a cab fast, so that I wouldn't have to waste time squatting on Fifty-fourth Street at rush hour with my head between my legs. Ah, well, I thought feverishly, "I grow old . . . I grow old . . . I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled," an ague hath my ham; marrow fatigue, not enough exercise, no tennis, badminton, swimming, fencing, volleyball, modern dance, <i>any </i>dance. I missed school gymnasiums, horseback riding; all I did now was tramp concrete sidewalks and wooden stages and Central Park on weekends. Middle age was phasing out into senility. I fooled the cabdriver, though, by smiling at him so he wouldn't notice all the change I dropped as we pulled up to 15 West Eighty-first Street, across from the Hayden Planetarium. Dark and cool, its dingy Moorish fountained-and-tiled lobby always welcomed me home from the wars. I rose in the elevator, gratefully trying to snuggle against its ancient varnished paneling, and finally stood with ossified feet in the small hall outside my door. The hall was semiprivate; unfortunately it provided wizened old Mrs. Rosenbaum and myself with a common meeting ground, ours being the only two apartments opening off it. She endowed it richly with a perpetual odor of cabbage, and I with an expensive new lay or wallpaper to distract from her barbaric cuisine.</p><h2>Systems Theory and Family Therapy: A Primer</h2><p>This book provides an overview of the basic concepts of a systems theoretical perspective using families and family therapy as examples and illustrations of their application in professional practice.</p><p>Raphael Becvar is a Licensed Psychologist, a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, and an Approved Supervisor with many years of experience in both academic and private practice contexts.

With a foundation of native Maya dishes made from fresh local ingredients, it shares much of the same pantry of ingredients and many culinary practices with the rest of Mexico. Yet, due to its isolated peninsular location, it was also in a unique position to absorb the foods and flavors of such far-flung regions as Spain and Portugal, France, Holland, Lebanon and the Levant, Cuba and the Caribbean, and Africa. In recent years, gourmet magazines and celebrity chefs have popularized certain Yucatecan dishes and ingredients, such as Sopa de lima and <i>achiote</i>, and global gastronomes have made the pilgrimage to Yucat�n to tantalize their taste buds with smoky pit barbecues, citrus-based pickles, and fiery chiles. But until now, the full depth and richness of this cuisine has remained little understood beyond Yucat�n's borders.</p><p>An internationally recognized authority on Yucatecan cuisine, chef David Sterling takes you on a gastronomic tour of the peninsula in this unique cookbook, <i>Yucat�n: Recipes from a Culinary Expedition</i>. Presenting the food in the places where it's savored, Sterling begins in jungle towns where Mayas concoct age-old recipes with a few simple ingredients they grow themselves. He travels over a thousand miles along the broad Yucat�n coast to sample a bounty of seafood; shares "the people's food"at bakeries, <i>chicharroner�as</i>, street vendors, home restaurants, and cantinas; and highlights the cooking of the peninsula's three largest cities&#x2014;Campeche, M�rida, and Valladolid&#x2014;as well as a variety of pueblos noted for signature dishes. Throughout the journey, Sterling serves up over 275 authentic, thoroughly tested recipes that will appeal to both novice and professional cooks. He also discusses pantry staples and basic cooking techniques and offers substitutions for local ingredients that may be hard to find elsewhere. Profusely illustrated and spiced with lively stories of the region's people and places, <i>Yucat�n: Recipes from a Culinary Expedition</i> is the long-awaited definitive work on this distinctive cuisine.</p></p><p>David Sterling is founder, proprietor, chef de cuisine, and teacher at Los Dos Cooking School, the first culinary institute in Mexico devoted exclusively to Yucatecan cooking. His work at Los Dos has been featured on The Martha Stewart Show (&#x201c;Martha in Mexico&#x201d;) and Mexico: One Plate at a Time with Rick Bayless. He&#x2019;s also been acclaimed by the New York Times, the New Yorker, Gourmet, Travel &amp; Leisure, Globe &amp; Mail, ELLE, National Geographic Traveler, Cond� Nast Traveler, and Frommer&#x2019;s.*Starred Review* This is not just a cookbook; it&#x2019;s also a labor of love that well documents places, people, and, yes, food on Mexico&#x2019;s Yucatan peninsula. In fact, one south-of-the-border culinary maven who has blessed Sterling&#x2019;s endeavor (through TV appearances) is Rick Bayless. Is there really a difference between Yucatan menus and dishes from other Mexican states? Sterling points to the extensive use of recados (curries) and alcaparrados (capers, raisins, olives, and almonds) as well as influences from Spain and Portugal, France and Holland, and Lebanon, Cuba, and Africa to create such dishes as sopa de lima and achiote. The more than 275 recipes are gathered in groupings based on the heartland, the coast, the cities, and the villages, populated, too, with excellent photographs of many Yucatan natives (meet 73-year-old Hern�n Perrera Novelo, who still farms his plot). Ingredients are featured with a description and their culinary uses, including both familiar and indigenous, such as avocado, cashew apples, oscillated turkey, and lobster, to mention a handful. It will be difficult not to turn on all the burners and oven to try pilikanes, turkey in maize, fish-head soup, pan dulce, or crispy fried pork skin. --Barbara Jacobs</p><h2>Broken Memory: A Novel of Rwanda</h2><p>Hiding behind the old sofa, five-year-old Emma does not witness the murder of her mother, but she hears everything.

It is rather Kenya Haras attempt to explore the essence of "White", which he sees as being closely related to the origin of Japanese aesthetics &#x2013; symbolizing simplicity and subtlety. The central concepts discussed by Kenya Hara in this publication are emptiness and the absolute void. Kenya Hara also sees his work as a designer as a form of communication. Good communication has the distinction of being able to listen to each other, rather than to press one&#x2019;s opinion onto the opponent. Kenya Hara compares this form of communication with an "empty container". In visual communication, there are equally signals whose signification is limited, as well as signals or symbols such as the cross or the red circle on the Japanese flag, which &#x2013; like an "empty container" &#x2013; permit every signification and do not limit imagination. Not alone the fact that the Japanese character for white forms a radical of the character for emptiness has prompted him the closely associate the color white with emptiness.</p><p><p>Born 1958.

In it, noted cultural historian Thomas Berry provides nothing less than a new intellectual-ethical framework for the human community by positing planetary well-being as the measure of all human activity.<br><br>Drawing on the wisdom of Western philosophy, Asian thought, and Native American traditions, as well as contemporary physics and evolutionary biology, Berry offers a new perspective that recasts our understanding of science, technology, politics, religion, ecology, and education. He shows us why it is important for us to respond to the Earth&#x2019;s need for planetary renewal, and what we must do to break free of the technological trance&#x201d; that drives a misguided dream of progress. Only then, he suggests, can we foster mutually enhancing human-Earth relationships that can heal our traumatized global biosystem.</p><p>"This volume quite possibly is one of the ten most important books of the twentieth century."<br>--Dr. Donald B. Conroy, President, North American Conference on Religion and Ecology"Beyond all my experiences with universities, literature, and wisdom traditions, Thomas Berry's work has opened the door for me to the most thrilling, over-arching, inclusivist, all-embracing and empowering perspective I have ever encountered."--Paul Winter, musician <br><br>"<i>The Dream of the Earth </i>provides a brilliant, integrating perspective on our responsibility to the larger Earth community."--Terry Deacon, Department of Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley</p><h2>Organizational Leadership: Foundations and Practices for Christians</h2><p>Kingdom leadership does not begin and end at the church door. Christians are called to conduct leadership in government, commerce, schools, neighborhoods, families, para-church ministries and a myriad other contexts. God has given us many gifts, and our responsibility is to be stewards of those gifts, and use them to do the King?s work. In that context, this comprehensive text explores key facets of leadership from a Christian worldview so as to equip people to conduct leadership more authentically than would be possible under alternative paradigms. The book begins with the seldom considered theological foundations of leadership while also tracing the historic roots of management, organization and leadership theories. All of this leads to a robust discussion of five essential challenges and practices--communication, negotiation, decision-making, financial stewardship and personal development. The combined efforts of these experts in the field provide a practical theology of leadership from a Christian worldview for emerging and established leaders. Here is the foundation needed for those who want to conduct leadership in a manner consistent with their faith in both religious and nonreligious organizational contexts.</p><p>John S.

He is the department chair and professor of public service and leadership at DWU."God has inspired scientists, theologians and theorists to offer tools for leading in profound and Christ-like ways. By introducing substantial theory, theology and best practices, <em>Organizational Leadership</em> shows the depth of knowledge, wisdom, discernment and strategy available to Christian leaders." (Damon M. Seacott, CCCU Advance, Fall 2014)<br><br>"<em>Organizational Leadership</em>is a well-researched and well-written anthology on leadership by eight contributing authors. Filled with practical anecdotes, the authors address leadership issues, including calling, theological and theoretical foundations, communication, conflict, negotiation, decision-making, financial integrity and sustaining leadership. . . . The first and last chapters by Tim Dolan are worth the price of the book." (Larry Lindquist, Preaching, May 2014)<br><br>"Does Christian faith have anything to contribute to understanding the theory and practice of leadership? Most assuredly, <em>yes</em>! This book offers a much-needed practical theology on organizational leadership, providing perspectives and principles for readers to be 'salt and light' and 'as shrewd as serpents and as innocent as doves' in their formal and informal leadership roles." (J. Stanley Mattson, founder and president of the C. S. Lewis Foundation and director of the C. S. Lewis Study Centre at the Kilns, Oxford, England)<br><br>"What I love most about this book is its weaving of Scripture, devotion to Jesus Christ, leadership history and theory, and grounded experience. Its authors provide a marvelous resource that can be read both as a primer and as an advanced study in leadership that is biblically responsible, developmentally accessible, academically engaging and practically valuable." (Mark Labberton, president, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"While the list of leadership books seems to grow almost daily, very few of them will offer the scope and the synthetic approach that this volume provides. The ten essays in this book will assist readers in visiting the broad landscape of the Christian leadership genre and in sampling the best of secular resources. I will be excited to put this book into the hands of my students." (Jim Singleton, associate professor of pastoral leadership and evangelism, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary)<br><br>"<em>Organizational Leadership</em> is the outcome of godly writers whose commitment to biblical authority provides a refreshing, theologically sound perspective to the vast field of leadership literature. It is a brilliant confluence of practical advise, moral boundaries for decision makers and fascinating examples of good and bad practices of leadership. I heartily recommend <em>Organizational Leadership</em> to all those aspiring to be Christ-honoring leaders." (Paul A. Kienel, founder and president emeritus, Association of Christian Schools International)<br><br>"[<em>Organizational Leadership's</em>] topical comprehension and biblical grounding provide considerable food for thought for Christians at the helm of organizations, whether secular or Christian." (Gerald Wisz, CBA Retailers + Resources, June 2014)<br><br>"Overall, the authors offer sound wisdom for conducting leadership effectively. Because of its dual emphasis on leadership constructs and leading from a Christian perspective, the book is an ideal text for undergraduate or graduate level courses on leadership. It could also serve leaders of religious and non-religious organization who want to develop themselves and their team members to be more effective leaders."

Coauthored by chef-instructor (and parent) Mark Ainsworth, this book is for kids ages ten to fourteen who love to cook or who want to learn how, from the perspective of the nation&#x2019;s best culinary college. It begins with techniques&#x2014;from key cooking methods to staying safe in the kitchen to how food fuels your body&#x2014;then augments those lessons with more than one hundred recipes for dishes that kids (and their families and friends) will love, from Chinese &#x201c;Takeout&#x201d; Chicken and Broccoli to Mexican Street Corn Salad to DIY Hummus to Raspberry Shave Ice. These recipes are easy enough that beginners can try them with confidence, but are loaded with insider tips, fun facts, kitchen vocab, and other teaching moments so that more adventurous junior cooks can use them as a springboard to take their skills to the next level, express their culinary creativity, and have fun in the kitchen!<br>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Founded in 1946, The Culinary Institute of America is the world&#39;s premier culinary college.

For more information, visit www.ciachef.edu.Gr 4&#x2013;7&#x2014;Ainsworth and the Culinary Institute of America have created a solid and comprehensive cooking manual that has something to offer for new and practiced young cooks. With clear and succinct discussions on sanitary practices and knife handling, as well as strong tutorials on cooking methods and the creation of flavorful food, this title emphasizes important cooking fundamentals in an orderly and bold way. Recipes are organized mostly by meal but also include fun snacks, such as Mexican street corn salad, curry burritos, and pickle chips. Directions are clear and detailed, and the author takes special care to define cooking terms such as sweating and mirepoix. "Think Like a Chef" sections are peppered throughout and provide ideas for creative recipe variations, while "Chef's Note" sections give helpful substitution ideas and problem-solving techniques. Photos are appealing and enhance the dishes, but the relatively few illustrations that the book features resemble clip art and do not add anything to the work. Overall, the recipes are varied and appealing, with the only weak spot appearing in the dessert section, which features two overly simple, no-bake recipes that are primarily made up of Oreo cookies. Considering the earlier encouragement to limit processed food and preservatives, this makes little sense and seems like a missed opportunity.

Art, government, society itself emulated, as much as possible, the search for perfection dictated by the call to virtue. However, Christendom&#39;s grand experiment had both peaks and troughs. Ultimately, the twentieth century&#39;s many disasters and Christendom&#39;s failure to stop revolution and world war have discredited Christianity itself in the eyes of many.Nevertheless, I am convinced that only Christianity can revitalize a culture that has lost most of its connection with beauty and that glorifies banality, variety, and diversity as ends in themselves. However, this would not be a retread of historical Christendom, but a new vision, predicated on the new realities of an increasingly Neo-pagan and Transhumanist West. Russian philosopher Ivan Ilyin puts even more bluntly:&#34;The Gospel teaches not flight from the world, but the Christianization of the world. Thus, the sciences, the arts, politics, and the social order can all be those spiritual hands with which the Christian takes the world. And the calling of a Christian is not to chop off those hands, but to imbue their work and toil with the living spirit of Christ. Christianity has a great calling, which many do not ever realize. This purpose can be defined as the creation of a Christian culture.&#34;This book is Ivan Ilyin&#39;s attempt at a spiritual and practical handbook at creating Christian culture in an increasinly post-Christian world.

The following period was a charged and transformative time of unrest. Insurgent leaders, trained in Ottoman military tactics and with everything to lose from the fall of the Empire, challenged the mandatory powers in a number of armed revolts. This is a study of this crucial period in Middle Eastern history, tracing the period through popular political movements and the experience of colonial rule. In doing so, Provence emphasises the continuity between the late Ottoman and Colonial era, explaining how national identities emerged, and how the seeds were sown for many of the conflicts which have defined the Middle East in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. This is a valuable read for students of Middle Eastern history and politics.</p><p>This book is for students interested in modern Middle East history, the origins of the Middle East, the impact of colonialism, and modern politics and conflict.

According to Fleming, these factors-which include high blood cholesterol level (over 150), excess weight, elevated homocysteine (resulting from eating too much animal protein) and oxidants in the blood stream-trigger an inflammatory reaction that causes heart disease and may also be responsible for diabetes, arthritis and other serious conditions. Dismissing bypass surgery and angioplasty as short-term solutions, Fleming claims that his suggested diet, combined with regular exercise such as daily walking, will reverse heart disease without medication or surgery. He recommends that his diet be adopted in two phases: phase one is composed solely of fruit and vegetables; after consistent improvement in cardiac health has been accomplished, phase two, which adds whole grains, low-fat dairy and moderate servings of protein, may be undertaken. A variety of sample recipes and menus are provided. Fleming is opposed to the currently popular high-protein diets for losing weight. Although his exercise and eating plan certainly promotes health, the diet, which also eliminates caffeine, may discourage those who find it too restrictive. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She lives in Leawood, Kansas, with her husband and three children.PreSchool-Grade 2-Appealing picture books written by attachment-parenting advocates. In the first title, the anticipation of a baby is shown as an opportunity for family members to love and support one another. The text, addressed to an older sibling, describes both the changes that the family prepares for and the ways that the baby, growing inside the mother's uterus, might make her feel: hungry, thirsty, and tired. Older brothers and sisters are encouraged to see themselves as competent to contribute at this time. What Baby Needs is a warm look at how life in the family changes to accommodate the needs of a newborn, and the care an infant requires. Both texts are prefaced by notes for adults on what kind of information and experiences might be helpful or appropriate to share with a child. In addition, sets of text bars throughout give parents and youngsters the opportunity to talk more about the issues raised by the simpler text of the books. In each book, the lighthearted, full-color cartoons bring some welcome new images to baby books: breastfeeding, babywearing (including both a dad and a mom with an infant in a baby sling), and the newborn snoozing near the parents' bed in an adjacent co-sleeper. Final pages in both volumes provide interested adults with notes on attachment parenting, including its key components (birth bonding, breastfeeding, babywearing, co-sleeping, and belief in the language value of a baby's cry).<br><i>Kathie Meizner, Montgomery County Public Libraries, Chevy Chase, MD </i><br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Seven Surrenders: Book 2 of Terra Ignota (Terra Ignota, 2)</h2><p><p><b>*2018 LOCUS AWARD FINALIST FOR BEST SCIENCE FICTION NOVEL CATEGORY*</b><br><b></b><br><b>From 2017 John W.

He is the author of the novel <em>Gates of Fire</em> and a well-known screenwriter whose screenplays include "Above the Law" and "Freejack." He lives in the Los Angeles area.<p>We were crossing between the nines now. The surge to the tenth tee carried the massed throngs away from the ocean to a run of five inland holes. The gallery's weight and depth seemed to cut off all breeze; the heat hit you like a blast oven. The backs of Jones' and Hagen's shirts were drenched with sweat as we climbed the rise to the tenth tee. Junah removed his hat and buried his face in a towel; the moisture was </p><p>dripping from it; I gave him tea and an apple and a big chunk of ice, which he wrapped in his pocket kerchief and applied to his burning neck.</p><p></p><p>The big scoreboard by the tourney tents was visible when he reached the height of the tee. Hagen 35, Jones 36, Junah 41. The nine behind felt like a war zone; it seemed impossible that the competitors still had a siege of 27 more holes to play.</p><p></p><p>Jones lashed a monster down the right side, a screaming yardage-devouring hook that arced out and back over the rough, hit the fairway steaming and bounded forward with overspin to slow finally, curling safely around the flank of a bunker I'd paced off the </p><p>night before at 285.</p><p></p><p>Junah barely noticed, so tightly was he held by Bagger Vance's eyes. "What can I do, Bagger? Tell me." </p><p></p><p>Hagen was stepping to tee his ball; Vance kept his voice low. "I require only one thing of you, Junah. That you swing your True Swing. Your Authentic Swing." </p><p></p><p>"What the hell do you think I want?" Junah hissed. "How do I do it?" </p><p></p><p>He paused for Hagen's address. Sir Walter ripped one, a high dead-straight boomer that was all carry, splitting the middle and landing just a few yards behind Jones', settling onto a clean flat lie, 190 from the 464-yard green. The applause echoed; then the gallery turned to Junah, who still stood over his bag, his face inches from his caddie's. </p><p></p><p>The caddie held out the champion's driver. </p><p></p><p>"Remember, the game is simple. The ball doesn't move. It simply sits and waits. Now strike it, Junah. Hold nothing back. Hit it with everything you have." </p><p></p><p>Vance set Schenectady Slim in Junah's hands. You could see the champion's head was whirling, his brain beyond overload. The gallery sensed an apocalypse. Hagen and Jones did too. I was in terror that Junah might faint, collapse, actually fall down, so dizzy and disorientated did he seem. I shut my eyes, too terrified to watch as Junah teed his ball and stepped to it. I squinted to see him look back at Vance, one last time. Then he set himself, glanced once down the fairway... </p><p></p><p>Junah's clubhead started back. Before it reached the top, the gallery knew. Judge Anderson knew, my father knew, everyone who had ever seen and marveled at Junah's swing when it was on ...they all knew. He was on plane. On track. On rails. The big persimmon </p><p>hit the slot at the top exactly, you could see Junah's wrists cock fully into their ultimate power position, his knees and hips had already started rotating forward into the shot as the clubhead reached its zenith, high and geometric, left arm at full extension, and then, not with a slash or a blast but almost in slow motion the club powered through the hitting zone. The sound was like a bomb. The gallery gasped as the ball exploded off the clubface, low and hissing fire, and boomed down the narrow alley between the massed formations. Heads snapped, trying to follow its speed. There was a quick intake of breath, then a joyous release of tension, applause and a rush of awe and appreciation. I looked at Jones and saw a small curl of pleasure in his lip; he appreciated it too. Hagen was already striding off the tee, head down, ignoring the shot, which meant of course he had seen it and took it seriously. I peered toward the far right bunker, the one Jones' ball had rolled to, whose carry paced off at 285. Junah's drive cleared it on the fly, took one long hard hop, then settled into a low ground-hugging roll, coming to rest 30 yards farther on, 315 from the tee, with Tawdry Jones the forecaddie sprinting in its wake to jubilantly plant his bright white flag. Three-fifteen cold. Thirty yards past Jones, nearly 40 beyond Hagen. </p><p></p><p>Junah himself could barely believe it. Not so much the prodigiousness of the blow, as he had hit many as well and better, but that somehow it had appeared at this time, when his swing had seemed utterly incapable of producing it. He turned to Bagger Vance, as if expecting a winking smile or a thumbs-up. But the caddie was already striding for the fairway, instructing me to give Junah another of my iced apples and make sure he ate it. "You are your swing, Junah," he muttered to the champion as he passed. "We will </p><p>find that swing today and, having found it, nothing will ever take it from you again." </p></p><h2>Alice: Alice Roosevelt Longworth, from White House Princess to Washington Power Broker</h2><p><b>An entertaining and eye-opening biography of America's most memorable first daughter</b><br><br>From the moment Teddy Roosevelt's outrageous and charming teenage daughter strode into the White House&#x2014;carrying a snake and dangling a cigarette&#x2014;the outspoken Alice began to put her imprint on the whole of the twentieth-century political scene. Her barbed tongue was as infamous as her scandalous personal life, but whenever she talked, powerful people listened, and she reigned for eight decades as the social doyenne in a town where socializing was state business. Historian Stacy Cordery's unprecedented access to personal papers and family archives enlivens and informs this richly entertaining portrait of America?s most memorable first daughter and one of the most influential women in twentieth-century American society and politics.</p><p>Stacy A. Cordery is chairman of the history department at Monmouth College in Illinois and is the author of <i>Theodore Roosevelt: In the Vanguard of the Modern</i>. She is the bibliographer for the National First Ladies&#x2019; Library. This is her third book.The fiercely intelligent eldest daughter of President Teddy Roosevelt (1884&#x2013;1981) was rebellious and outspoken partly as the result of her desperation to gain the attention of an emotionally distant father, according to historian Cordery. Utilizing Alice's personal papers, Cordery describes how she was more devastated by the political infidelity of her husband, House speaker Nicholas Longworth, during the 1912 presidential election (he sided with Taft over TR) than by his sexual dalliances. Her own affair with powerful Idaho Sen. William Borah resulted in the birth of her only child, Paulina. When her beloved father died in 1919, the stoic Alice simply omitted it completely from her autobiography, and she was a poor mother to Paulina, who died in 1957, at 32, from an overdose of prescription medicines mixed with alcohol. Alice's independence of mind often led her against the grain: she worked to defeat Wilson's League of Nations and was a WWII isolationist and America First activist. Her witty syndicated newspaper columns criticized FDR and the New Deal, and she betrayed her cousin Eleanor by encouraging FDR's liaison with Lucy Mercer Rutherford. Cordery (<i>Theodore Roosevelt: In the Vanguard of the Modern</i>) pens an authoritative, intriguing portrait of a first daughter who broke the mold.

One can trace its roots to the Calculus of Variations and the work of Euler and Lagrange. This natural and reasonable approach to mathematical programming covers numerical methods for finite-dimensional optimization problems. It begins with very simple ideas progressing through more complicated concepts, concentrating on methods for both unconstrained and constrained optimization.</p><p><p>Numerical Optimization presents a comprehensive and up-to-date description of the most effective methods in continuous optimization. It responds to the growing interest in optimization in engineering, science, and business by focusing on the methods that are best suited to practical problems.</p> <p>For this new edition the book has been thoroughly updated throughout. There are new chapters on nonlinear interior methods and derivative-free methods for optimization, both of which are used widely in practice and the focus of much current research. Because of the emphasis on practical methods, as well as the extensive illustrations and exercises, the book is accessible to a wide audience. It can be used as a graduate text in engineering, operations research, mathematics, computer science, and business. It also serves as a handbook for researchers and practitioners in the field. The authors have strived to produce a text that is pleasant to read, informative, and rigorous - one that reveals both the beautiful nature of the discipline and its practical side.</p><p>MMOR Mathematical Methods of Operations Research, 2001: "The books looks very suitable to be used in an graduate-level course in optimization for students in mathematics, operations research, engineering, and others.

A Pulitzer Prize-winner for his ground-breaking reporting on the Vietnam War, Halberstam wrote more than 20 books, almost all of them bestsellers. His work has stood the test of time and has become the standard by which all journalists measure themselves.<em><br><br>The Teammates</em> is the profoundly moving story of four great baseball players who have made the passage from sports icons--when they were young and seemingly indestructible--to men dealing with the vulnerabilities of growing older. At the core of the book is the friendship of these four very different men--Boston Red Sox teammates Bobby Doerr, Dominic DiMaggio, Johnny Pesky, and Ted Williams--who remained close for more than sixty years.<br><br>The book starts out in early October 2001, when Dominic DiMaggio and Johnny Pesky begin a 1,300-mile trip by car to visit their beloved friend Ted Williams, whom they know is dying. Bobby Doerr, the fourth member of this close group--"my guys," Williams used to call them--is unable to join them.This is a book--filled with historical details and first-hand accounts--about baseball and about something more: the richness of friendship.</p><p>As baseball legend Ted Williams lay dying in Florida, his old Boston Red Sox teammates Johnny Pesky and Dom DiMaggio piled into a car and drove 1,300 miles to see their friend. Another member of the close-knit group, Bobby Doerr, remained in Oregon to tend to his wife who had suffered a stroke. Besides providing a poignant travelogue of the elderly Pesky and DiMaggio's trip, David Halberstam's <i>The Teammates</i> goes back in time to profile the men as young ballplayers. Although it is enlightening to learn about Doerr, Pesky, and DiMaggio, the leader of the group and star of the book is Williams. Halberstam portrays the notoriously moody and difficult Williams as a complex man: driven by a rough childhood and a fiercely competitive nature to become perhaps the greatest pure hitter of all time while also being a magnetic personality and loving friend. While there is nothing exceptionally unusual about old men who have stayed friends (plenty of people stay friends, after all), baseball gives this particular relationship a unique makeup. Unlike most friendships, that of Williams, Doerr, Pesky, and DiMaggio was viewed all summer long by hooting, hollering Red Sox fans. As such, their bond is forged both of individual accomplishment, win-loss records, numerous road trips, and, since they played for the Red Sox, annual doses of disappointment. Halberstam, author of <i>Summer of '49</i> and <i>October 1964</i> is the ideal writer to tell two equally intriguing stories, both rich in America's pastime. Although he occasionally drops himself into the narrative, one expects that of Halberstam and gladly accepts it in exchange for the highly readable exposition infused with poetic majesty that has become his trademark. <i>--John Moe</i><strong>David Halberstam</strong> (1934-2007) was the author of twenty-two books, including fifteen bestsellers. Born in New York City, Halberstam spent much of the 1960s as a reporter for <i>The New York Times</i>, covering the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights movement. His Vietnam reporting earned him both a George C. Polk Award and a 1964 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting. <i>Vanity Fair</i> dubbed Halberstam "the Moses of American journalism," and the subjects of his books reflect his passion and range: war, foreign policy, history, and sports. <i>The Best and the Brightest </i>(1962), his sixth book, a critique of the Kennedy administration's Vietnam policy, became a #1 bestseller. His next book, <i>The Powers that Be</i>, a study of four American media companies, was hailed by <i>The New York Times</i> as a "prodigy of research." Many of Halberstam's books explored themes in professional sports, including bestsellers <i>The Teammates</i>, a portrait of the friendship between baseball players Ted Williams, Dominic DiMaggio, Johnny Pesky, and Bobby Doerr, and <i>The Education of a Coach</i>, a profile of New England Patriots' Coach Bill Belichick. <br><strong></strong><br><br> <strong>Jane Leavy</strong> is the author of the<em> New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>The Last Boy</em>, <em>Sandy Koufax: A Lefty's Legacy</em>, and the comic novel <em>Squeeze Play</em>.

But now the malevolent creatures that normally skulk in the shadows of the park grow bolder, and old secrets hint at a violent explosion.<br><br>The brewing conflict draws John Ross to Hopewell. A Knight of the Word, Ross is plagued by nightmares that tell him someone evil is coming to unleash an ancient horror upon the world. Caught between them is fourteen-year-old Nest Freemark, who senses that something is terribly wrong but has not yet learned to wield the budding power that sets her apart from her friends.<br><br>Now the future of humanity depends upon a man haunted by his dreams and a gifted young girl--two souls who will discover what survives when hope and innocence are shattered forever . . .</p><p>Terry Brooks's <i>Running with the Demon</i> is billed as "A Novel of Good and Evil," but he could've called it "A Novel of Here and Now." The fantasy master behind the Shannara series switches his focus from neo-Tolkien jungles to the woebegone steel town of Hopewell, Illinois. Though Illinois teenager Nest Freemark (where does he get these names?) looks like your average kid, she spends her free time in the woods asking her 6-inch pal Pick for advice in dodging the Demon and his creepy Feeders, spirits who gobble the souls of humans. Nest is also being tailed by John Ross, a shining Knight of the Word who wants to keep her from the Feeders' jaws.<p> Meanwhile, in the real world that dominates the novel, Nest Freemark is being stalked by a handsome, evil classmate who she has rejected, and a pack of surly, insurgent striking steelworkers plot a bombing at the company's Fourth of July picnic. The boy and the bombers are unaware that they're being subconsciously manipulated by the Demon. The book's matter-of-fact take on the uncanny is a bit like <i>The X-Files</i>. (And if you want to compare the two, check out Ted Edwards's <i>X-Files Confidential: The Unauthorized X-Philes Compendium</i>.)</p><p> Brooks's plot has more strands than a plate of pasta, yet his mind is logical to a fault--he used to be a lawyer. There's something for everyone: gory monster attacks, a dread family secret, magical mind-game duels, even a (rather flat) teen-romance subplot. The setting has real grit and the countdown to the Independence Day bombing peps up the tale. Brooks sometimes prosaically explains things a better literary stylist would dramatize, and his minatory visions of environmental apocalypse are more fun than the obvious, nagging, don't-be-a-litterbug message they exist to convey. Brooks will never be as deep as Tolkien, and many readers will find him less awesome as their adolescence recedes. Still, he's the genuine article, and with this book, he raises the stakes he's playing for.</p>"FABULOUS . . . A breathtaking run of near-catastrophes and revelations . . . His fans should embrace it as eagerly as they have The Sword of Shannara."<br>--Publishers Weekly (starred review)<br><br>"Running with the Demon is by far the best of Terry Brooks's many wonderful novels: darker, starker, classically written, and with a brand new mythos to fuel its contemporary plot.

It's set in Egypt inside a pyramid decorated with hieroglyphics and treasures. "A mummy cat, who's passed through death" reminisces about his owner, the girl-queen Hatshepsut, as he searches the rooms looking for her. "He checks to see if she's come back, his loving friend...so that this lonely time can end." Although it's obvious that the memories weigh him down at times, he perks up when he sees pictures of the two of them in painted scenes along the walls. The cat was a loyal companion and a hero to the girl, right to the end of both of their lives. Back matter includes in-depth information about mummies and the ancient queen. The hieroglyphs are defined here as well, and they can be used as an I Spy game, as they appear throughout the book. Brown's ink, gouache, watercolor, and digital collage illustrations are rich with beautiful ancient artifacts and a grouping of curious mice and moths that follow the mummy cat to the tomb of the girl he can never forget. VERDICT Kids will enjoy this memorable and touching introduction to mummies.&#x2014;Tanya Boudreau, Cold Lake Public Library, AB, Canada</p><h2>Biology for the Logic Stage Student Guide</h2><p>Biology for the Logic Stage leads the middle school student through a study of plants, animal life, and the human body by digging deeper into what was studied during the elementary years.&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t emphasize this enough: the program is well organized and easy to navigate.

But the true depth of the devastation of removal cannot be understood without a closer examination of the history of the Dakota people and their deep cultural connection to the land that is Minnesota. Drawing on oral history interviews, archival work, and painstaking comparisons of Dakota, French, and English sources, Mni Sota Makoce tells the detailed history of the Dakota people in their traditional homelands for at least hundreds of years prior to exile.<br><br>"Minnesota" is derived from the Dakota phrase Mni Sota Makoce, Land Where the Waters Reflect the Clouds&#x2014;and the people's roots here remain strong. Authors Gwen Westerman and Bruce White examine narratives of the people's origins, their associations with the land, and the seasonal round through key players and place names. They consider Dakota interactions with Europeans and offer an in-depth "reading between the lines" of historical documents&#x2014;some of them virtually unknown&#x2014;and treaties made with the United States, uncovering misunderstandings and outright deceptions that helped lead to war in 1862.<br><br>Dakota history did not begin with the U.S.&#x2013; Dakota War of 1862&#x2014;nor did it end there. Mni Sota Makoce is, more than anything, a celebration of the Dakota people through their undisputed connection to this place, Minnesota, in the past, present, and future.</p><p>Bruce White is a historian and anthropologist who specializes in Native American history and culture in the Great Lakes region in the context of treaty litigation and the protection of sacred sites and cultural places. He is the author of We Are at Home.In an account from around 1720, an unknown Frenchman recorded&nbsp;the Dakota belief that the first of their people came from the ground&nbsp;on the prairie between the mouth of the Minnesota River and the Falls&nbsp;of St. Anthony. In April 1754, Dakota chiefs gathered with a French diplomat,&nbsp;Joseph Marin, at a fort along the Mississippi River to complain&nbsp;about incursions by Ojibwe into their territory. One of the chiefs laid&nbsp;before Marin a map of the region and said, &#x201c;No one could be unaware&nbsp;that from the mouth of the Wisconsin to Leech Lake, these territories&nbsp;belong to us. On all the points and in the little rivers we have had villages.&nbsp;One can still see the marks of our bones which are still there,&nbsp;which are the remains from the Cristinaux and the Sauteux having&nbsp;killed us. But they never can drive us away. These are territories that&nbsp;we hold from no one except the Master of Life who gave them to us.&nbsp;And although we have been at war against all the nations, we never&nbsp;abandoned them.&#x201d;</p><h2>In My Father&#39;s Court</h2><p><p>Like Isaac Bashevis Singer's fiction, this poignant memoir of his childhood in the household and rabbinical court of his father is full of spirits and demons, washerwomen and rabbis, beggars and rich men.

In lively and impassioned prose, she breaks down three key dualisms -- sex/gender, nature/nurture, and real/constructed -- and asserts that individuals born as mixtures of male and female exist as one of five natural human variants and, as such, should not be forced to compromise their differences to fit a flawed societal definition of normality.</p><p><b>Anne Fausto-Sterling</b> is the Nancy Duke Lewis Professor of Biology and Gender Studies in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Biochemistry at Brown University.<br></p><h2>Make a Zine!: Start Your Own Underground Publishing Revolution</h2><p><b>The second edition of this incredibly useful guide on how to makes zines, especially in the Digital Age.</b><br><br>In this new edition of Microcosm's popular DIY guide to zine-making, Joe Biel updates the information provided in the first edition (edited by Biel and the late and great Bill Brent) to address zine making in today's digital and social-media-obsessed world.

Have an Affair</b> <p>I thought the title of this strategy would grab your attention and would be a great place to begin this book! </p><p>Okay, not that kind of affair! </p><p>The kind of affair I'm talking about is a love affair with life. If there's one thing I've noticed that seems to be lacking in many men, it's a passion for life. It seems that many of us have lost that sense of wonder and awe for the incredible gift of life itself. We've become lost in the multitude of responsibilities, ambitions, drive, and commitments. We've become very serious and heavyhearted. Many of us have lost our sense of humor and our perspective. We've lost our compassion, as well. Instead of marveling at it all, we take life for granted. We become stuck in the mundane and succumb to boredom. It's as if we're doing nothing more than putting in time and going through the motions. </p><p>Life is slowly passing us by. Without a genuine sense of enthusiasm, a zest for life and a lighthearted spirit, we take our problems and obstacles too seriously. We become uptight and a drag to be around. More than anything else, we start sweating the small stuff. Life starts to bother us instead of amusing us. People are seen as burdens instead of as gifts. Challenges are dreaded instead of seen as opportunities. </p><p>The solution to all of this is to have an affair with life. The idea is to reignite your passion for living, and to see the extraordinary in the ordinary. Remind yourself how precious and how short this adventure really is. I read a great book called <i>A Parenthesis in Eternity</i>. What a great way to think about the duration of your life -- as a blip on a passing screen. We're here for a moment in time -- and then we're gone. Why waste one second on self-pity, frustration, irritation, and all the rest? Our lives are so much more important than that. </p><p>It's shocking what happens to the quality of your life when you put it into this perspective. All of a sudden, the things that seemed so big seem small. And the things that seemed so small -- and the things we postpone and take for granted -- seem so big! We see that, for the most part, we usually prioritize in reverse order. But we can change all that in a moment. We can make a shift right now. </p><p>The things that we so often attach importance to are important, but it's a question of degree. Success, perfection, achievement, money, recognition -- you can have them all, but they're not everything. In fact, without a passion and appreciation for life, they don't amount to much. </p><p>I was talking to a group of men about this subject. A few days later, I received a call from one of them that sums up the essence of this strategy. He said that while we were talking, he had thought that my "intentions" were good, but that I didn't really understand how serious and important his "role" was to everyone. </p><p>As fate would have it, while driving home that evening, his life changed in a single moment. He was nearly clipped by a huge truck on the freeway. He wasn't hurt, but it was a very close call. The near miss brought forth the insight that he hadn't spent virtually any time with any of his three children in several years, and that they were growing up very quickly. For the first time in years, tears came down his face as he realized that he was missing the point of life -- as well as his chance to live it. When he arrived at home, he sat down with his family and told them that he was going to be making some changes in his life, beginning with appreciating his family. He had had a major change of heart. </p><p>Although this type of realization often has to do with family, it's not just about family. It's even larger than that. Recognizing the miracle of life -- and having an affair with it -- means that you being to attach great value to the moments of everyday life. The people you live and work with -- and, for that matter, go grocery shopping with -- all take on far more importance. Nature appears more beautiful, life is more precious, "things" and conveniences are more appreciated. You become, not less effective, but less demanding on others and on yourself, because you better understand the relative importance and significance of the events around you. Things won't get to you so much, and you won't be sweating the small stuff -- at least, not as often! </p><p>An affair with life is real, and it can happen to anyone at any time. All it takes is the commitment to reflect upon the miracle of life itself and to remember, each day, how lucky we are to be alive. Think about what it means to wake up in the morning and have "another day to live". Some day, that won't be the case. In the meantime, live each day like it really matters -- because it does. </p><p>One final note on this subject. Needless to say, an affair with life will never get you into any trouble with your wife or girlfriend. On the contrary, they will appreciate your change of heart as much as you do. So have fun. </p><p>Copyright � 2001 Richard Carlson, Ph.D.</p></p><h2>Transform Your Boundaries</h2><p>Your boundaries are doing only one thing &#x2013; trying to take care of you.

Are you one of them? If so, <i>Firescaping</i> helps you create a safer environment. This unique form of landscaping design keeps your property healthy, clean, and clear. Land management expert Douglas Kent shares decades of experience working in many of the nation&#x2019;s most flammable areas. </p><p>Get the information needed to determine your property&#x2019;s degree of fire risk. Learn effective design strategies for your home and landscape, as well as key characteristics that make your property more accessible to firefighters. With checklists, simple instructions, and tips that truly work, this practical, hands-on guide is a valuable resource for homeowners, business owners, landscape professionals, and fire protection agencies. If you live in an area at risk, this book can help to prepare you and give you peace of mind.</p></p><p>Douglas Kent began work on Firescaping in 1992. He lived 25 miles northwest of the Tunnel Fire, which had devoured 25 lives and 2,900 homes in the Berkeley/Oakland Hills area of California. Both frightened and inspired, Kent began to compile a guide that would help prevent others from enduring such a tragedy. <br>In the years since, Kent has toured, worked with, and spoken to high-risk communities throughout California. He has been on the front lines of wildfires and has interviewed many survivors. With this edition of Firescaping, he uses all his years of fire experience to create a comprehensive resource that homeowners and at-risk communities nationwide can use to create more fire-resistant landscapes and structures. <br>Kent has 27 years of soot-filled experience in firescaping, but that is far from his only credential. He started gardening in 1979 and has written six other books, has worked on hundreds of landscape projects, has helped lead four statewide gardening campaigns, and has taught at California Polytechnic University, Pomona, since 2008.<p><b>THE ZONE THEORY</b> </p><p>In the middle of a murky landscape stands a lone house. Its walls are a grayish, sticky black, and the ground cover of periwinkle and iris is singed and curled but still green. All surrounding shrubs are ash. The horizon is torn by jet-black, leafless trees. Chimneys and large piles of soot are seen in the distance, the only remains of the neighbors&#x2019; houses. </p><p>The scene described above accompanies almost every fire. In the midst of a charred landscape sits a single home, somehow protected from the fire that consumed all others. This chapter emphasizes the reasons why some houses are able to survive. It is a model from which all landscapes should be designed. </p><p>Firescaping&#x2019;s Zone Theory differs from the standard model by addressing the elements that create a beautiful and functional landscape as well as a fire-protected property. Planting for a sense of privacy or holding a hill can unintentionally create a lot of fuel. A good landscape design will not only help defend a home against the threat of fire, but will serve the unique goals of the individuals who care for it as well. </p><p>The Zone Theory is perfectly suited for large properties. People who manage small lots, properties on steep slopes, and houses nestled under a grove of trees may find the model cumbersome. Chapter 10 covers slopes; Chapter 11 covers small properties; and Chapter 12 covers ridgetop and understory properties. </p><p><b>ZONE 1: THE GARDEN ZONE/DEFENSIBLE SPACE</b> </p><p><b>Distance:</b> Extends 30 feet from all sides of a house or structure. </p><p><b>Primary goal:</b> The garden zone/defensible space is the most important zone in this model. Without igniting, this zone must be able to withstand firebrands and intense heat, between 900�F and 1,300�F. Everybody and anybody should be able to move unencumbered and swiftly through the garden zone. Firefighters will battle a blaze within these first 30 feet. </p><p><b>Secondary goals:</b> The garden zone has to maintain high recreational, functional, and/or economic value to remain useful to its occupants. The ideals of beauty and privacy play a large role in determining plant selection. Fences, hedges, sheds, compost areas, and stored items, such as firewood, are common in this zone and add a lot of fuel. </p><p><b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b> </p><p><b>PLANT SELECTION</b> Plants in the garden zone must wilt and sizzle, but not ignite, when exposed to flames and heat. This means that plants in this zone will likely be broad-leaved, supple, and moist. This group is considered fire retardant. Chapter 13 (&#x201c;Plant Selection and Fire Protection&#x201d;) has Zone 1 plant lists for lawn alternatives, festive perennials, and accent trees. </p><p><b>CARE AND MAINTENANCE</b> The garden zone will consume a disproportionate amount of a landscape&#x2019;s budget. And rightly so&#x2015;lives are at stake within this zone. The garden zone also consumes the most water, resources, and time. The most fire-retardant plants will require irrigation and attention, more so in arid environments. Food crops, lush understory plantings, and tropical plantings are some examples of high-maintenance plants that survive firebrands and intense heat. </p><p><b>ACCESS AND ESCAPE</b> The garden zone is where firefighters will fight a fire, so wide, stable pathways must surround the entire structure. There should be a place to stage equipment and people, and clear sight lines to escape routes and the surrounding landscape. Everyone should be able to move through this zone with ease, never worrying about ducking, tripping, or getting entangled. On large lots, it is essential to have and maintain two ways off the property. Refer to Chapter 14 (&#x201c;Landscape Features&#x201d;) for more on paths. </p><p><b>GARDEN FEATURES</b> The garden zone may contain a lot of ignitable features: fences, furniture, play structures, shade structures, and storage sheds are common. Naturally, using noncombustible materials, such as metal, is the surest strategy. But there are other strategies too. Refer to Chapter 14 (&#x201c;Landscape Features&#x201d;) for more detail. </p><p><b>SOURCES OF IGNITION</b> Many places in the garden zone are likely to produce sparks and flames. Barbecues, fire pits, and work areas need to be designed to handle the occasional spark: flammable vegetation must be cleared around them; Zone 1 plants used; and dead, dying, and diseased vegetation constantly removed. </p><p><b>MAINTENANCE</b> Maintenance is the fulcrum of fire protection. Fire must not be allowed in the garden zone, and the role of maintenance cannot be stressed enough. Refer to the maintenance chapters (Chapters 16&#x2013;18) for priorities, techniques, and timing of maintenance tasks. </p><p><b>RVS AND TRAILERS</b> </p><p>RVs and trailers can be a huge liability during a wildfire: once they ignite, they are incredibly difficult to extinguish. They catch firebrands with canvas contraptions, leafy debris underneath, and openings in paneling and compartments, and they propel a fire with rubber, thin paneling, and stored fuel. </p><p>RVs and trailers can be protected:<br> </p><ul><li>Remove awnings and other firebrand-catching appendages.</li> <li>Blow or sweep debris from underneath the vehicle.</li> <li>Remove flammable vegetation at least 10 feet around the vehicle.</li> <li>Install curtains that can deflect heat on all windows.</li></ul> <p><b>ZONE 2: THE GREENBELT/FUEL BREAK</b> </p><p><b>Distance:</b> 31&#x2013;70 feet from a protected structure. Houses on slopes need to add 10 feet to this zone for every 10% increase in slope. For example, the greenbelt would extend to 120 feet on a property that has a 50% slope. </p><p><b>Primary goal:</b> The greenbelt should stop a ground fire. Select low-growing, hearty, and water-thrifty plants. These plants are the most fire resistant. The effects of droughts, freezes, and occupant neglect should have the least impact in this zone. </p><p><b>Secondary goals:</b> Within view of a house, privacy, aesthetics, and wind protection play important roles in plant selection and placement. These goals add a lot of fuel to this zone over time. On sloping properties, controlling erosion is one of the most important roles of this zone....</p></p><h2>Poetry for Young People: Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (Volume 6)</h2><p>Children instinctively love poetry, with its appealing mixture of rhythm and rhyme.

The practical advantages of the full score derive mainly from the clarity of its typography, the economy of sides occupied by what elsewhere often involves a succession of irritating page turns, and a sense that the whole enterprise has been coaxed through the press with maximum care. Likewise, the vocal score is uncluttered and easy to use. * Early Music Today Aug 99 * What is impressive is the breadth of information that is presented in user-friendly terms . . . This is certainly an extremely helpful and practical edition which will serve as a very useful resource for performer and scholar alike. * Early Music May 99 * Indeed the OUP version is notable for its economy. It is clear, uncluttered and as near as possible to what Handel wrote . . . All users will find the Introduction to the vocal score interesting. The choral conductor will find additional information and helpful, practical guidance in the full score . . . Mention of orchestral parts brings me to an important characteristic of the whole of this edition - clarity, and a feeling of spaciousness. Players welcome this, and for the orchestral librarian of the Northern Sinfonia, the orchestra in the Huddersfield launch the parts are the clearest he has worked with in 35 years experience . . . This is undoubtedly a quality production. If a choir is contemplating a new set of Messiah (and the scores and parts are readily compatiible with other editions) this one must be at the top of the short list. * Howard Layfield, Mastersinger Spring 99 * In the succinct comentary to the full score, there is a useful guidance over rhythmic conventions and a heartening open-mindedness about the validity of a wide variety of interpretations . . . The printing and layout are examplary, and the vocal score is very competitive in price. The full score is exceptional value and is extremely practical. * Martin Neary, Early Music Review Dec 98 * The players loved the parts - clear and clean, and I loved the edition; almost everyone in the Hall (the sell-out audience of 1200+ and all the performers) had a marvellous evening . . . Please convey my congratulations to [Clifford Bartlett] and the setters and printers, and yourselves, of course, as publishers, for doing everyone such a great favour in producing this wonderful new edition - it&#39;s the one for me!! * Colin Touchin (Director of Music, University of Warwick) * Bartlett&#39;s line on performance practice is sensible and non-didactic . . . The result is an edition that&#39;s clean and unfussy, refreshingly uncluttered by superfluous grace-notes or odd-looking demi-semiquaver ornaments . . . Bartlett&#39;s edition, however, makes it perfectly possible to reconstruct the 1742 Dublin, 1743 London, or 1750 revised Messiah, according to taste, which should afford music directors hours of innocent fun. * The Singer December 98 *</p><h2>Aquarian Tarot Deck</h2><p>By David Palladini.

While she takes aim at alpha females, the untold secret is that this book is for all women.

She's the quintessential modern woman--assertive, razor sharp, and fully in control. Her success in the marketplace is undeniable, a downright boon to society. But what happens when the alpha woman gets married?<br> <br> She becomes an alpha wife, of course.<br> <br> An alpha wife is in charge of everything and everyone. She is, quite simply, the Boss.&nbsp;The problem is, no man wants a boss for a wife. That type of relationship may work for a spell, but it will eventually come crashing down.<br>Since 1970, just as women became more and more powerful outside the home--more alpha--the divorce rate has quadrupled. And it is women who lead the charge. Today, 70% of divorce is initiated by wives. <br> Do men just make lousy husbands? Not at that rate, says cultural critic and Fox News contributor Suzanne Venker. The truth is that women weren't raised to be wives. No one told them their real power lies in their femininity.&nbsp;<br>Being 'strong and independent' sounds good on the surface, but it often translates to being difficult--and no man wants that. There's an art to loving a man, and any woman can master it.<br>An alpha woman herself, Venker learned how to be a wife the hard way--through trial and error. Lots of error. And here's what she knows today: The set of skills a woman needs to pursue a career, or even to raise children, is the exact set of skills that will destroy her marriage.&nbsp;<b><i><br>The Alpha Female's Guide to Men &amp; Marriage</i> gives women who are used to being in charge the tools they need to make their marriages less competitive and more complementary</b>.

(Douglas Brinkley), "a mesmerizing read" (Bing West), and "an essential part of anyone's library" (Doug Stanton), <i>The Force </i>tells the riveting, true story of the group of elite US and Canadian soldiers -- mountainmen, lumberjacks, hunters, and explorers -- who sacrificed everything to accomplish a crucial but nearly impossible WWII mission.</b><b><br></b>In December of 1943, as Nazi forces sprawled around the world and the future of civilization hung in the balance, a group of highly trained U.S. and Canadian soldiers from humble backgrounds was asked to do the impossible: capture a crucial Nazi stronghold perched atop stunningly steep cliffs. The men were a rough-and-ready group, assembled from towns nested in North America's most unforgiving terrain, where many of them had struggled through the Great Depression relying on canny survival skills and the fearlessness of youth. Brought together by the promise to take part in the military's most elite missions, they formed a unique brotherhood tested first by the crucible of state-of-the-art training-including skiing, rock climbing, and parachuting-and then tragically by the vicious fighting they would face. <br> The early battle in the Italian theatre for the strategic fort cost the heroic U.S.-Canadian commando unit-their first special forces unit ever assembled-enormous casualties. Yet the victory put them in position to continue their drive into Italy, setting the stage for the Allies' resurgence toward victory in WWII. The unit, with its vast range of capabilities and mission-specific exercises, became a model for the "Green Berets" and other special forces groups that would go on to accomplish America's most challenging undertakings behind enemy lines. <br> <br>Knitting first-hand accounts seamlessly into the narrative-drawing on interviews with surviving members and their families; the memoirs, letters, and diaries of Forcemen; and declassified documents in the American, Canadian, British, and German archives<i> -- The Force</i> tells a story that is as deeply personal as it is inspiring.</p><p><b>Saul David</b> is a military historian and broadcaster.

She glanced up from the register, head tilted, and imagined that a sparrow had flown through an open window again and was circling the store&#x2019;s airy upper floors, trying to find its way out.<br> <br>A few seconds later another book fell. This time it thudded more than flapped, and she was sure it wasn&#x2019;t a bird.<br> <br>It was just past midnight, the bookstore was closing, and the final customers were checking out. Lydia was alone at the register, scanning a stack of paperback parenting books being bought by a teenage girl with pitted cheeks and peeling lips. The girl paid in cash and Lydia smiled at her but didn&#x2019;t say anything, didn&#x2019;t ask what the girl was doing alone at a bookstore this late on a Friday night, didn&#x2019;t ask when she was due. When the girl got her change, she met Lydia&#x2019;s eyes for a moment, then rushed out without any bookmarks.<br> <br>Another book fell, definitely somewhere upstairs.<br> <br>One of Lydia&#x2019;s comrades, a balding guy named Ernest who walked like a Muppet but always looked sad, was standing by the front door, guiding the night&#x2019;s final customers into Lower Downtown.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you hearing that?&#x201d; Lydia said from across the store, but her voice was too quiet and anyway Ernest was occupied. She watched him unlock the door he&#x2019;d just locked to let in a clubbing couple who looked drunk.<br> <br>&#x201c;They need to pee,&#x201d; Ernest said, shrugging in Lydia&#x2019;s direction.<br> <br>Outside, a few scruffy BookFrogs lingered on the flagstone sidewalk, zipping up backpacks and duffels, drinking from gallon jugs of water they&#x2019;d refilled in the bathroom. One had a pulp crime paperback crammed in his back pocket. Another had a pencil on a string tied to his belt loop. They stood together but none of them spoke, and one by one they slumped separately into the city, off to sleep in a run-down basement in Capitol Hill, or on a bench in Union Station, or in the sticky cold of Denver&#x2019;s alleys.<br> <br>Lydia heard another faint flapping. Definitely a falling book, followed by a few more in rapid succession: flap-flap-flap. The store was otherwise quiet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Upstairs empty?&#x201d; she said to Ernest.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just Joey,&#x201d; Ernest said, but his eyes were fixed on the corner of zines and pamphlets that flanked the bathrooms where the drunk couple had just disappeared. &#x201c;Do you think they&#x2019;re screwing in there?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He knows we&#x2019;re closed?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Joey?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You never know what Joey knows. He asked after you earlier, by the way. It may have been the longest conversation we&#x2019;ve ever had. &#x2018;Seen Lydia?&#x2019; I was touched.&#x201d;<br> <br>Most days Lydia made a point of tracking Joey down wherever he&#x2019;d settled into the store&#x2014;a corner table in the coffee shop, or the former church pew in the Spirituality section, or even under the Story Tree in Kids&#x2014;to see what he was reading and how he was feeling and whether any odd jobs had come his way. She had a soft spot for the guy. But tonight she&#x2019;d gotten caught in the store&#x2019;s after-dinner rush and never tracked him down.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lyle is with him, right?&#x201d; Lydia said. Though decades apart in age, Joey and Lyle were all but inseparable, like two halves of one smart and awkward beast.<br> <br>&#x201c;No Lyle. Not tonight. Last I saw, Joey was all alone in History. He had masking tape on his fingers.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;On his fingers?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think he must&#x2019;ve cut himself or burned himself. Made bandages with Kleenex and tape.&#x201d; He looked at his watch. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not a crackhead, is he? They&#x2019;re always burning fingers.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lydia heard another fluttering book. The store occupied three cavernous floors, and when it was quiet like this, sound traveled between them as if through an atrium. She imagined Joey all alone lobbing books up there, some kind of bibliomancy or I Ching toss. She&#x2019;d be the one to stay late and reshelve them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Count the drawer for me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Goddamned couple,&#x201d; Ernest said, coming around to the register without unpeeling his eyes from the bathrooms. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve gotta be screwing in there.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lydia crossed the store&#x2019;s gritty floors and headed up the wide, tiered staircase that reached through the building like a fattened spine. Ernest had gone through earlier and turned off most of the overhead lights upstairs, so she felt as if she were climbing into an attic.<br> <br>&#x201c;Joey?&#x201d;<br> <br>The second floor was quiet, shelf upon shelf of books standing still. She continued to the third.<br> <br>&#x201c;Joey?&#x201d;<br> <br>Joey was the youngest of the BookFrogs, and by far Lydia&#x2019;s favorite. This wouldn&#x2019;t be the first time that she or one of her bookselling comrades had done a final sweep at closing and found Joey knocking books off the shelves, searching for a title that may or may not have actually existed. His glossy hair would be draped over his eyes, and he&#x2019;d be wearing black jeans and a black knit sweater with the collar just low enough to see the top of his tattooed chest. The wooden floors around his feet would be spread with books about subjects as far-reaching as his thoughts: Sasquatch sightings and the Federal Reserve, Masonic rites and chaos theory. He was a shattered young man, Lydia often thought, haunted but harmless&#x2014;a dust bunny blowing through the corners of the store.<br> <br>She liked having him around.<br> <br>&#x201c;Joey?&#x201d;<br> <br>The third floor was dim and peaceful. Lydia stepped into a familiar warren of tall wooden shelves and followed their angles and branches into different alcoves and sections, each holding a chair or a couch, a table or a bench: Psychology, Self-Help, Religion, Travel, History.<br> <br>Something squeaked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Last call, Joey.&#x201d;<br> <br>When she stepped into the Western History alcove, she could feel her eyes trying to shut out what she was seeing: Joey, hovering in the air, swinging like a pendulum. A long ratcheted strap was threaded over a ceiling beam and looped around his neck. Lydia&#x2019;s body sprung with terror, but instead of running away she was suddenly running toward him, toward Joey, and hugging his lanky legs and trying to hoist him up. She heard someone&#x2019;s scream curdle through the store and realized it was her own.<br> <br>Lydia&#x2019;s cheek pressed into Joey&#x2019;s thigh and his jeans were warm with urine. A lump in his pocket smelled of chocolate and she assumed it was a knot of melted Kisses, swiped from the bowl on the coffee shop counter. His hands were clenched into quiet fists and she could see the masking-tape bandages on three or four of his fingertips, but she wouldn&#x2019;t look up again at the popped purple sockets of his eyes, nor the foamy saliva rolling down his chin, nor the blue swelling of his lips.<br> <br>She could see the cemetery of books that had flapped to the floor as Joey had climbed the shelves, and the others he&#x2019;d shoved aside to create footholds as he threaded the strap through the ceiling, and still others that had dropped as he&#x2019;d tried to kick his feet back to stop himself from dying. By now she&#x2019;d locked her hands together on the far side of his thighs and was trying to lift him up, but her sneakers kept slipping on the wooden floor, and each time she slipped the ratcheted strap cinched tighter around his neck. She must have stopped screaming because a ringing silence suddenly swallowed everything when she saw, a few inches from her face, poking up from Joey&#x2019;s front pocket, a folded photograph of her.<br> <br>Lydia.<br> <br>As a child.</p><h2>The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Transpersonal Psychology</h2><p><p><i>The Wiley Blackwell Handbook of Transpersonal Psychology</i> presents the most inclusive resource yet published on this topic - which seeks to benefit humanity by integrating ancient wisdom and modern knowledge.</p> <ul> <li>Features the work of more than fifty leading voices in the field, creating the most comprehensive survey of transpersonal psychology yet published</li> <li>Includes emerging and established perspectives</li> <li>Charts the breadth and diversity of the transpersonal landscape</li> <li>Covers topics including shamanism, neurobiology, holotropic states, transpersonal experiences, and more</li> </ul></p><p><p>"In summary, this volume succeeds in accomplishing a lot.

This hardcover book is filled with fun how-to guides for everyday adventures. It includes tips and tricks for mystery solving (how to make invisible ink and create secret codes), travel (how to pack a suitcase; how to take great snapshots), and enjoying the great outdoors. Each of the four Boxcar Children has their own section&#x2015;practical advice from Jessie, a &#x201c;roughing it&#x201d; guide from Henry, crafts and art projects from Violet, and recipes from Benny! A great gift for Boxcar fans.</p><p>Gertrude Chandler Warner was born in 1890 in Putnam, Connecticut, where she taught school and wrote The Boxcar Children because she had often imagined how delightful it would be to live in a caboose or freight car. Encouraged by its success, she went on to write eighteen more stories about the Alden Children.</p><h2>The Blackwater Lightship: A Novel</h2><p>It is Ireland in the early 1990s. Helen, her mother, Lily, and her grandmother, Dora have come together to tend to Helen's brother, Declan, who is dying of AIDS. With Declan's two friends, the six of them are forced to plumb the shoals of their own histories and to come to terms with each other. <br> Shortlisted for the Booker Prize, <i>The Blackwater Lightship</i> is a deeply resonant story about three generations of an estranged family reuniting to mourn an untimely death. In spare, luminous prose, Colm T�ib�n explores the nature of love and the complex emotions inside a family at war with itself. Hailed as "a genuine work of art" <i>(Chicago Tribune),</i> this is a novel about the capacity of stories to heal the deepest wounds.</p><p>In the opening pages of <i>The Blackwater Lightship</i>, a stranger drives up to Helen O'Doherty's Dublin house to tell her that her brother Declan is in the hospital and needs to see her. At his request, she joins him at the creepy seaside house of their grandmother--where, as children, they awaited news of their dying father. What's more, they're not the only guests. Paul and Larry, friends of Declan who have known about his HIV diagnosis far longer than his family, are the next to arrive. And then comes Helen's estranged mother Lily, whom she hasn't seen in years. Still angry over the emotional abandonment she suffered during her youth, Helen had refused even to invite Lily to her wedding. Now she must come to terms not only with the imminent death of her beloved brother but also with her mother and grandmother--all at once.<p> Colm T�ib�n (<i>The Story of the Night</i>) delivers this unsentimental account of a troubled family in spare but suggestive language. He does allow his characters a few high-spirited remarks and the occasional outburst. Otherwise, though, he keeps his tone even, allowing for the perfect integration of a light, unforced symbolism. For Lily, broken hopes and dreams are bound up with the Blackwater Lightship, one of two lighthouses that once stood in the Irish Sea near Ballyconnigar. As a child, she believed that these would always be there: </p><blockquote> Tuskar was a man and the Blackwater Lightship was a woman and they were both sending signals to each other and to other lighthouses, like mating calls. He was forceful and strong and she was weaker but more constant, and sometimes she began to shine her light before darkness had really fallen. </blockquote> For Helen, on the other hand, it was the house itself that prompted her deepest, happiest fantasies. But now Lily has sold the property and shattered Helen's dream that "it would be her refuge, and that her mother, despite everything, would be there for her and would take her in and shelter her and protect her. She had never entertained this thought before; now, she knew that it was irrational and groundless, but nonetheless ... she knew that it was real and it explained everything." What Declan has done by drawing them all together at Granny's house is to enact this potent, poignant fantasy. Whether it has the power to reconstruct his family is another matter, but in any case, <i>The Blackwater Lightship</i> remains a gripping narrative, deftly delivered by a master storyteller. <i>--Regina Marler</i><b>Praise for <i>The Blackwater Lightship</i>:</b> <br> <br>&#x201c;This is a brilliant achievement.&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Ottawa Citizen<br></i> <br>&#x201c;An exceptionally fine piece of writing.&#x2026;It&#x2019;s a measure of T�ib�n&#x2019;s craft that he can sustain his honest, steady gaze on the enigma of life.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Globe and Mail</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;This is the most astonishing piece of writing, lyrical in its emotion and spare in its <br>construction.&#x2026;T�ib�n has crafted an unmissable read.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Sunday Herald</i> (U.K.) <br> <br>&#x201c;A genuine work of art.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><h2>Magdalene: Poems</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Gorgeous, ferocious, lacerating, sexy, and profoundly compassionate.&#x201d;&#x2015;Michael Cunningham</strong></p><p><em>Magdalene</em> imagines the biblical figure of Mary Magdalene as a woman who embodies the spiritual and sensual, alive in a contemporary landscape&#x2015;hailing a cab, raising a child, listening to news on the radio. Between facing the traumas of her past and navigating daily life, the narrator of <em>Magdalene</em> yearns for the guidance of her spiritual teacher, a Christ figure, whose death she continues to grieve. Erotic, spirited, and searching for meaning, she is a woman striving to be the subject of her own life, fully human and alive to the sacred in the mortal world.</p></p><p>Marie Howe is the former poet laureate of New York and the author of three previous collections. Magdalene was longlisted for the National Book Award. Howe teaches at Sarah Lawrence College and lives in New York City.&#x201c;A smart, engrossing collection.... Readers of any religious background will find much that seems familiar in the modern-day everywoman who sees herself in the faces of a woman wearing a burka, a woman who longs for children and one who hails a taxi wearing a black suit and high heels.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Marie Howe is magic. And in this book, her biggest magic trick is making the iconic biblical character, Mary Magdalene, both mystical and relatable, at once mythological and completely contemporary.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Rumpus</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In these powerful and accessible poems, Howe advocates nothing so narrow as a particular religious faith; instead, she seems to argue, loving the world, in spite and because of suffering, is life&#x2019;s great risk, and its reward.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>NPR</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A poignant portrait of contemporary womanhood....

Howe sweeps up a life and fixes it on the page, and stands here before us, the stunned and grateful witness of all that&#x2019;s taken and granted by love and time.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Mark Doty</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Marie Howe is among our most gifted poets of trauma and healing, and of where the everyday encounters the world of the sacred. In&nbsp;<em>Magdalene</em>, Howe raises the ante. She now channels the &#x2018;woman taken in adultery&#x2019; of New Testament legend, and she is also her questing self, lover and mother, risen to the exaltation of the possible.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Alicia Ostriker, author of&nbsp;<em>The Book of Seventy</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Marie Howe has always come as close as any poet since Rilke to touching eternity, simply by stretching out her hand and believing that something exists beyond her grasp, beyond her knowing. Here, with <em>Magdalene</em>, she somehow goes even deeper, into what it is to both be alive and a manifestation of the divine. I am, once again, in awe of her powers, at their fullest here.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Nick Flynn</strong></p><h2>Dragon Ball Z, Vol. 10</h2><p>As Freeza changes into new forms, each more powerful than the last, the desperate heroes--Gohan, Kuririn, Piccolo and the self-serving Vegeta--find themselves struggling merely to stay alive.

Lake was one of the most powerful healing&nbsp;evangelists of the twentieth century. His life&#x2019;s work&nbsp;included countless conversions, healings, and deliverances,&nbsp;as well as the establishment of hundreds of churches and&nbsp;ministries.<br> Now, the wisdom and experience of Lake&#x2019;s teachings on&nbsp;healing have been condensed into one book. Through these&nbsp;teachings, you, too, can:<ul><li>Receive physical and emotional healing</li><li>Discover the spiritual roots of sickness</li><li>Overcome fear and hopelessness</li><li>Remove hindrances to healing</li><li>Defeat the attacks of Satan</li><li>Walk in divine health</li><li>Minister healing to others</li><li>Win souls for eternity</li><li>Experience a new joy in your life</li></ul>The power of John G. Lake&#x2019;s healing ministry and its&nbsp;effect on the world is finally at your fingertips. Healing is&nbsp;available for you and your loved ones today!</p><p><b>John Graham Lake </b>(1870&#x2013;1935) was born in St. Mary&#x2019;s, Ontario, Canada. While he was still a child, his parents moved to the United States. At the age of twenty-one, he became a Methodist minister; however, he chose to start a newspaper in Harvey, Illinois, instead of accepting a church ministry. From the newspaper business, Lake expanded his career pursuits by opening a real estate office in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and then in 1904 he bought a seat on the Chicago Board of Trade. Through his real estate deals and his business acumen in insurance and investments, Lake amassed a sizeable fortune by today&#x2019;s standards.<br> In the meantime, his wife Jennie had suffered with a prolonged, progressively debilitating illness, but she was miraculously delivered under the ministry of John Alexander Dowie in April 1898. This experience forever altered the direction of John G. Lake&#x2019;s life and ministry.<br> During his business life, Lake had made it a practice of speaking somewhere practically every night, after which he joined like-minded friends in seeking the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Finally, while he and another minister were praying for an invalid woman, he experienced profound &#x201c;currents of power&#x201d; rushing through his entire being, and the woman was instantaneously healed.<br> In the spring of 1907, Lake closed his office for good and disposed of his bank accounts and all his real estate holdings by giving everything away to charity. He then began an independent evangelistic work with a single dollar in his pocket, being absolutely dependent on God for his every need. Lake went wherever the Lord directed him, and he and his family and his ministerial team were always well provided for, most often just at the moment when the provision was needed.<br> Lake is probably best remembered for his missionary work in South Africa, but his ministry in the United States was also powerful. One hundred thousand healings were recorded in five years at the Lake Healing Rooms in Spokane, Washington. Dr. Ruthledge of Washington, D.C., called Spokane &#x201c;the healthiest city in the world&#x201d; as a result.<br> What Lake accomplished as a result of his intense regard for the Word of God is an example to all Christians of what is possible for any person who will believe and act on the Scriptures.</p><h2>Act One: An Autobiography</h2><p>Moss Hart's <i>Act One</i>, which Lincoln Center Theater presented in 2014 as a play written and directed by James Lapine, is one of the great American memoirs, a glorious memorial to a bygone age filled with all the wonder, drama, and heartbreak that surrounded Broadway in the early twentieth century. Hart's story inspired a generation of theatergoers, dramatists, and readers everywhere as he eloquently chronicled his impoverished childhood and his long, determined struggle to reach the opening night of his first Broadway hit. <i>Act One</i> is the quintessential American success story.</p><p>Moss Hart was in the thick of American theater when everyone wore black tie on opening night and the world&#39;s most witty people entertained each other around a grand piano at late-night supper parties. It&#39;s an era of glamour that will never come again, but we have Hart&#39;s words on paper, and that is no small thing. A renowned director and theatrical collaborator, the brilliant Hart died too soon after the curtain went up on Act Two. If you want to know what it was like to be on the inside track in NYC in the &#39;30s, &#39;40s and &#39;50s, here&#39;s a good place to find out.In the opinion of the publishers, act one is the warmest, most engrossing?and by far the most revealing?book about the theatre that they have ever encountered.<br>It is, of course, a success story, for Moss Hart today is one of the most brilliant, successful and famous figures in the American theatre, both as a playwright and as a director.<br>How did it happen? Not easily. His boyhood and adolescent years were spent in two entirely different backgrounds, and the stories of both are fascinating. With the opening of his first Broadway play, Once in a Lifetime, his world changed abruptly. This book concludes with a detailed telling of the complicated steps whereby that play came into being. <br>?I consider the memories and pledges that were part of the struggle that preceded success the vital ones,? the author says. He has set these memories down with unusual candor, humor and excitement; and the book is an intimate and informative portrait, not only of him self but of the world of the theatre as well.</p><h2>Where Trust Lies (Return to the Canadian West)</h2><p>She loves her friends and students in the West, but family obligations have called her home.

When confronted with an empty white canvas, she is energized to create and express herself&#x2015;which is the greatest feeling of all.<br> With exuberant illustrations by Peter H.

He lives in Dedham, Massachusetts.K-Gr 3-In rhyming couplets, a girl describes her reactions to the exhibits in an art museum. A painting of a ballerina makes her want to pose, Van Gogh makes her "all twirly-whirly," some blue Cubism makes her "sad and blue," and she collapses in giggles at the sight of some squiggly abstract art. Finally, a blank white canvas first confuses, then inspires, her as she thinks of all the art she could fill it with. This book's strong point is the way it communicates a fresh, playful, childlike perspective on art and normalizes childlike responses to it. The idea that posing, laughing, and curious questions are all appropriate museum behavior may be a new one for both children and parents, and knowing this is sure to make for more enjoyable museum visits. Unfortunately, the pedestrian verse scans quite awkwardly, lessening the impact of the text. The explanation of the "blank canvas" is misleading as well-a white canvas hanging in a museum is likely not "mine to fill/the way I choose," as the narrator concludes. On the other hand, the cartoon illustrations are pleasantly uncluttered and full of energy. They include riffs on several famous works of art, though they are not identified by name and artist.

The church was old and decrepit, and its neighborhood--known as "Better Leave, You Effing Fool," or "the Bluff," for short--had the highest rates of crime, homelessness, and incarceration in Georgia. Expecting his time there to only last six months, Deel was not prepared for what happened next. One Sunday, he was approached by a woman he didn't know. "I've been hooking and stripping for fourteen years," she said. "Can you help me?"<br><br>Soon after, Bruce founded an organization called City of Refuge rooted in the principle of radical trust. Other nonprofits might drug test before offering housing, lock up valuables, or veto a program giving job skills and character references to felons as "a liability." But Bruce believed the best way to improve outcomes for the marginalized and impoverished was to extend them trust, even if that trust was violated multiple times--and even if someone didn't yet trust themselves. Since then, City of Refuge has helped over 20,000 people in Atlanta's toughest neighborhood escape the cycles of homelessness, joblessness, and drug abuse.<br><br>Of course, trust alone can't overcome a broken system that perpetuates inequality. Presenting an unvarnished window into the lives of ex-cons, drug addicts, human trafficking survivors, and displaced souls who have come through City of Refuge, <i>Trust First </i>examines the context in which Bruce's Atlanta neighborhood went downhill--and what City of Refuge chose to do about it. They've become a one-stop-shop for transitional housing, on-site medical and mental health care, childcare, and vocational training, including accredited intensives in auto tech, culinary arts, and coding. While most social services focus on one pain point and leave the burden on the poor to find the crosstown bus that'll serve their other needs, Bruce argues that bringing someone out of homelessness requires treating all of their needs simultaneously. This model has proven so effective that a dozen new chapters of City of Refuge have opened in the US, including in California, Illinois, Ohio, Maryland, Virginia, Texas, and Georgia. <br><br>More than a narrative about a single place in time, this radical primer for behavioral change belongs on every leader's shelf. Heartfelt, deeply personal, and inspiring, <i>Trust First</i> will break down your assumptions about whether anyone is ever truly a lost cause. Bruce will donate a portion of his proceeds from <i>Trust First</i> to the charitable organization City of Refuge.</p><p>Bruce Deel founded City of Refuge in 1997. He is the Senior Pastor of The Mission Church and a graduate of Lee University in Cleveland, TN. As a result of his experience and success, Bruce has become a highly sought after speaker and serves as a consultant to numerous non-profits around the country.<p><b>Chapter 1: "A Gentle Downward Pressure"<br></b><br> Twenty years ago, I showed up on a dilapidated corner of Bankhead Highway, in one of Atlanta&#x2019;s roughest corridors, with a van full of food. I had just formed a nonprofit called City of Refuge, and this was my first attempt to go out into the community to serve people in crisis, people who for whatever reason had not found a safe, comfortable path through the wilderness of life.<br><br>Maybe you&#x2019;ll be surprised to hear this, or maybe you won&#x2019;t: My first meal did not go smoothly. In fact, in the narrow window of three terrifying minutes, it made me wonder if I should go home and throw in the towel for good.<br><br>My first meal service was well underway that day, with a crowd of fifty or so people gathered for the best hot chili my wife Rhonda, a few volunteers, and I could put together. I was filling my umpteenth plastic bowl when I heard screaming. First a female voice, then a male one, in a jumbled string of obscenities. I scanned for the noise and saw a woman reach into her jacket pocket and pull out a gun. <br><br>My worries about what might go wrong that evening had been things like, <i>What if we run out of cheese? What if we can&#x2019;t plate food fast enough? </i>I hadn&#x2019;t once thought, <i>What if someone pulls out a .45-caliber pistol? </i>I was a white Christian pastor from rural Virginia who now lived in the Atlanta suburbs&#x2014;in other words, an interloper with no real knowl�edge of the streets. Nevertheless, I had shown up believing I could do some good by serving a desperate need. <br><br>People nearby immediately scattered into shadows and around corners. I then had a clear line of sight to the object of this woman&#x2019;s fury: a rail-thin man in baggy, dirty sweat�pants. His face showed hints of wornaway rouge and kohl that I wasn&#x2019;t sure what to make of. He was as aggressive as someone with a gun pointed in his face could possibly be, hurling insults that seemed to dare her to pull the trigger. Catcalls rang out from the shadows, excited fanfare that con�trasted wildly with my own anxiety. <br><br>Over the next months, years, and eventually decades, I would come to know these two angry combatants intimately. But that day, I had no idea who they were or how they had arrived there. I didn&#x2019;t know if they knew each other. I didn&#x2019;t know whether the gun had bullets or if Gloria (a name I would learn later) had ever pulled the trigger before. I didn&#x2019;t know exactly why they were so angry, so volatile, so seem�ingly bent on destruction at just the moment when a hot meal was coming their way. I knew only that they were matching each other stare for stare, threat for threat. My breath caught in my throat as sweat beaded my brow.<br><br>I glanced back at the building behind me, an empty ware�house beside a liquor store. The one volunteer who had come with me that day was standing inside the building&#x2019;s storm door, holding the handle. I could tell by the look on his face that he was holding the door shut, unwilling to step out into the fray.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t know yet that Gloria was seen on the streets as an unusually kind soul, a pleasant conversationalist who was known to share a blanket on a cold night or food from her own meager stash. I didn&#x2019;t know that she was alcoholic or how hard it was to combine that illness with being black and poor and come up with anything other than tragedy.<br><br>Though the whooping crowd had an obvious favorite (Glo�ria), I didn&#x2019;t know that Rufus was unanimously regarded as belligerent and hateful, quick to cut those with whom he dis�agreed, seemingly without reason. Nor did I know anything about his background&#x2014; that he had never had a safe place where he was loved unconditionally and that the closest approximation he&#x2019;d had was a community of needle- sharing prostitutes. I didn&#x2019;t know how many churches, erstwhile sanctuaries for those in need, had turned him away or im�posed conditions for participation that Rufus was unwilling to comply with. <br><br>I also didn&#x2019;t know how poorly I understood poverty and the ways it traps and traumatizes those in its grasp. Like so many privileged people, I had considered the problems of the poor only through the filter of my own experience. I&#x2019;ve already said I&#x2019;m a white guy from Virginia. While my family didn&#x2019;t have much money and my childhood was less than conventional, I had the privilege of two loving parents with high expectations for my future and a home of security, love, and opportunity. In other words, I was born with mo�mentum. <br><br>I didn&#x2019;t understand yet that poverty isn&#x2019;t caused by bad decisions as much as it compels them. I didn&#x2019;t recognize what I now call <i>opportunity injustice</i>, the individual and systemic factors that lock people in crisis&#x2014;poverty, untreated mental illness, and addiction, and the criminalization of all three. <br><br>Of course, knowing all that wouldn&#x2019;t have been much help in a gunfight anyway. Something more instinctive took me over&#x2014; all it adrenaline, or the stirrings of my upbring�ing. Growing up in the mountains of southwest Virginia, I was no stranger to a fight. I had never run from a conflict, and I didn&#x2019;t run from this one. Instead, I stepped gingerly between Gloria and Rufus, who at this point had both gone silent, furious eyes speaking loudly enough. I gently placed my hand on Gloria&#x2019;s. The steel barrel of the gun protruded from our coupled hands and she gave no indication of back�ing down.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t really want to do this, do you?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>As I said the words, I put just the slightest bit of gentle downward pressure on her hand. Time seemed to hang for a moment, none of us sure what would come next. But then I felt the tension ease in Gloria&#x2019;s body like a sigh. She dropped her arm to her side and slipped the gun into her jacket pocket. Rufus continued his mouthy commentary as I shared a mo�ment with Gloria, a deep sorrow in her eyes. She turned quickly and moved down the sidewalk, only her shadow walking with her. Rufus looked at the group that had enthusiastically booed him, taunted them with a smile, and turned to collect a bowl of chili from the table. I worked to slow my breathing, wiped the sweat from my face, and steadied myself against the table.<br><br>I finished the food service that day feeling exhausted and heavy of heart. I didn&#x2019;t want to have to go back to my family and tell them I might have put myself in harm&#x2019;s way. I didn&#x2019;t want to admit that the process of transformation I had imag�ined initiating that day with a kind word and a warm meal wasn&#x2019;t going to be very successful if every meal became a gunfight&#x2014;or worse, if someone ended up wounded or dead on the street. <br><br>I had arrived that day believing that each and every per�son was worthy of my humble resources of food, time, and attention. The day&#x2019;s events hadn&#x2019;t changed that. The day had made me realize just how humble my contribution would be, at least at first, given how little I knew these people and their problems. Had I been stupid to think I could make a differ�ence? Sure, they needed something or someone&#x2014;but did they need <i>me</i>? <br><br>And then I thought about that moment with Gloria. I thought about that feeling of tension leaving her body as I stepped into her space and touched her hand. A gesture so subtle that no eye could have spotted it, just a hint of pres�sure, accompanied by a simple question&#x2014;d<i>o you really want to do this?&#x2014;</i>had opened the possibility that there was a dif�ferent end to this story than the violent one her gun had set in motion. She answered the question peacefully and in her own truth: <i>No, I do not. </i><br><br>I&#x2019;m not sure if it was in that moment or looking back later, but I began to wonder if there <i>was </i>something unique I could offer, or was offering, beyond the food itself, even in my naive state as an outsider. I could arrive and be present without prejudice or assumptions, seeing each and every person as capable of making themselves whole and happy. In short, I could extend to these strangers an attitude of radical trust.<br><br>How many others might make different, better choices if they were on the receiving end of a gentle, trusting pressure that flooded them with the belief, or perhaps the memory, that no, they didn&#x2019;t want to do this&#x2014;<i>this </i>being falling victim to the forces that had left them desperately scrambling for food, without shelter, family, resources, or hope? How many times had the new congregants at my church&#x2014;or, for that matter, struggling people anywhere&#x2014;experienced the oppo�site of trust? I thought of all the strangers on the sidewalk, the shopkeepers, the authority figures, the men and women in uniform whose paths they had crossed. I imagined that every time they were watched with suspicious, wary eyes; every time they had been marked with labels that dehumanized them; every time they had been asked to put their hands on a wall or their chest on the pavement; that each of these instances must have walked them incrementally further from the belief that they were worthy of trust or endowed with potential.<br><br>I left that day understanding that my journey to help those in crisis would be different and more difficult than in my imaginings. I had a lot to learn. But I also left believing more than ever that the people I&#x2019;d meet on the street could change their own lives. They just needed someone to extend that gentle pressure.</p></p><h2>The Gifted Adult: A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius(tm)</h2><p>Are you relentlessly curious and creative, always willing to rock the boat in order to get things done . . . extremely energetic and focused, yet constantly switching gears . . . intensely sensitive, able to intuit subtly charged situations and decipher others' feeling?

She lives in St. Paul, Minnesota.1<br> BEYOND GIFTEDNESS: EVERYDAY GENIUS DEFINED<br> &nbsp;<br> No bird soars too high, if he soars with his own wings.<br> &#x2014;Friedrich Nietzsche<br> &nbsp;<br> To look at her, you would never suspect that Ann was in the midst of a crisis. She sat in my office, composed and resplendent in a black Tahari suit. The only sign of any agitation was her habit of coiling and uncoiling her index finger around her strand of pearls. She looked much younger than forty-three. As my client now for nearly four months, she, at first, had been at a loss to explain rationally what brought her to me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No one ever expects a midlife crisis, Dr. Jacobsen. I certainly didn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; were the first words that Ann spoke to me.<br> &nbsp;<br> At one point in her legal career, Ann had been a dynamo, working on a team that won a major case involving suspected violations of interstate commerce laws in the dairy industry. The lead attorney acknowledged that it was her dogged efforts that helped dismantle the government&#x2019;s case. Ann seemed destined to make partner before she was thirty-five and was guaranteed the pick of the firm&#x2019;s highest-profile and potentially most lucrative cases.<br> &nbsp;<br> Success hadn&#x2019;t come without a price. Those who were passed over for promotion in favor of Ann attributed her meteoric rise to favoritism and not her razor-sharp analytical skills, her amazing intuition, and her twenty-six-hour workdays. Once lauded as the consummate most valuable player, Ann was eventually plagued by not-so-quiet whispers about her chameleonlike ability to transform herself into whomever each partner wanted her to be. Suddenly the qualities that had once been her most valuable assets felt like her greatest liabilities.<br> &nbsp;<br> Always someone who took every criticism to heart, Ann stopped trusting her intuition and her allies. Rather than ranging far and wide to offer colleagues help, anticipating their problems before they even identified them, she kept to a carefully circumscribed territory in order to restore her coworkers&#x2019; regard for her. Her boundless interest and enthusiasm, previously characterized by being the first to volunteer to tackle the thorniest problem, now slid precipitously. She became aloof and distant.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;After all the problems I created by being a standout, I decided that the best way to get along was to go along and just joylessly grind my way through the day like everyone else. It seemed to be the only way that I could make working there bearable. Everyone else seemed pleased about my so-called change, but I was miserable.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A few months before Ann first came to see me, I&#x2019;d walked into my office one afternoon and was startled to find a man standing at the window tugging at one of the slats in the miniblinds and peering out at the street. He turned around and saw me. Then he took a couple of steps toward me, muttered, &#x201c;How ya doing, Doc?&#x201d; and stalked to the bookcase lining one wall. He pulled a book off the shelf and started leafing through it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You must be John,&#x201d; I said as evenly as I could. &#x201c;My clients usually wait in the reception area.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, I saw that other woman come out, so I came on in. You don&#x2019;t mind, do you.&#x201d; There was little to suggest that John was asking a question.<br> &nbsp;<br> John soon put back the book and took down a few others, smiling ruefully and shaking his head after examining a couple of their titles. Eventually I came to understand that John was very nearly incapable of keeping still for longer than a few minutes at a time. In this instance, the classic stereotype of the patient lying on the couch was laughable. John was the epitome of the restless peripatetic at home and at the office.<br> &nbsp;<br> Early on, John described how he perceived others. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like the rest of the world is moving along at twenty-four frames per second, normal film speed, but to me that&#x2019;s slow motion. Even when somebody&#x2019;s talking during a meeting, I swear I look at their mouths and it&#x2019;s like I&#x2019;m advancing the tape frame by frame on my VCR. So, okay, film and videotape are two very different things, so maybe that&#x2019;s not the best example, but maybe it&#x2019;s more like the world&#x2019;s a blender on stir and I&#x2019;m on liquefy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> John&#x2019;s self-editing and criticism aside, his description is apt. To someone like John, the rest of the world does seem as if it&#x2019;s lagging behind. From people walking too slowly on sidewalks and those counting out exact change in a supermarket checkout line to others arriving at a solution that seemed obvious to John minutes, days, or sometimes weeks before, everyone else always seemed to be moving at a glacial pace. A true multitasker, John used to upset everyone at meetings because he could monitor the flow of the conversation, read a report, scan the agenda for the next item of discussion, then jump ahead or interject at seemingly inappropriate moments.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sick of being told to slow down. If I&#x2019;m on an express train and they&#x2019;re on a local, why don&#x2019;t they switch trains and get onto mine? It&#x2019;s time for them to be responsible for catching up to me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Unfortunately for John, what others perceived as his uncooperative attitude eventually caught up with him. While he hadn&#x2019;t been fired from his job as a creative director at an advertising agency, he&#x2019;d been essentially stripped of all authority. He&#x2019;d been asked to stay on in a consulting capacity but was given little real work to do. John clearly sensed what was about to happen to him, but that only made him dig in his heels more deeply on some issues and veer recklessly from one more outlandish idea to the next, wielding his considerable wit like a saber. He&#x2019;d gone from being a visionary Renaissance man of the company to persona non grata in a matter of months.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It wouldn&#x2019;t bother me so much, but before I came along most of them thought that HTML was what you saw when some of the letters burned out in a neon hotel or motel sign. I got us a jump start into Web advertising, and now everyone is reaping the benefits and claiming they were the masterminds behind the whole thing. It&#x2019;s like working with a bunch of Al Gores claiming they were the ones who helped develop the World Wide Web. Of course, everybody knows that Dan Quayle was the one who invented the spell checker.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> GIFTEDNESS DENIED<br> &nbsp;<br> While John and Ann couldn&#x2019;t have been more different in certain respects, they do have much in common. They are both gifted adults standing poised at a crossroads. And they both initially recoiled at my suggestion that they were gifted.<br> &nbsp;<br> Like John and Ann, when many of us hear the word gifted we almost always think two things: (1) &#x201c;Only schoolchildren are gifted&#x201d; and (2) &#x201c;Since I&#x2019;m not a child, I can&#x2019;t be gifted.&#x201d; These automatic responses are understandable given what most of us have been told about bright people. But most of what we have been told is radically incorrect and enormously incomplete.<br> &nbsp;<br> Most of us think we know what giftedness is, but we&#x2019;re unable to describe it or define it accurately. Part of the reason for that is that we live in a culture that emphasizes products over process. We can see what gifted people produce, but we can&#x2019;t see the internal systems and operations that produced those products. In the previous sentence, even I had to resort to using words more suited to something manufactured mechanically than to how the brain really functions. While most people in society would accept the definition that giftedness is as giftedness does, it is not adequate for the purposes of this book.<br> &nbsp;<br> Most definitions of giftedness include these components:<br> &nbsp;<br> �&nbsp;Initially having and using natural abilities without benefit of formal training<br> �&nbsp;Rapid learning<br> �&nbsp;Creative and productive thinking<br> �&nbsp;High academic achievement<br> �&nbsp;Superior proficiency in one or more domains (e.g., mathematics, performing arts, leadership)<br> &nbsp;<br> As you can see, the emphasis is on the cognitive components of giftedness. While the cognitive components are certainly important to consider in discussing giftedness, too often there is a piece missing. Giftedness is not merely as giftedness does or as giftedness thinks. Instead, giftedness is as it thinks as well as feels, senses, perceives, and does.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Gifted Adult explores the psychology and personality of gifted adults&#x2014;the most underidentified group of potential achievers in our society. Regrettably, too often in our society those who would most readily be identified as &#x201c;smart&#x201d; are most at odds with making their intelligence work for them. Quite often it works against gifted adults, preventing them from producing the kind of products that traditionally are the markers of giftedness. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that we place a great deal of emphasis on educating gifted children. We understand that gifted children operate differently from those in the mainstream. As a result, we try to accommodate these differences among children by providing them with special programs and enrichment activities. However, even in the best school districts these programs are often inadequate and make the fundamental mistake of using only standard measures such as IQ as a basis for admission.<br> &nbsp;<br> Programs for the talented and gifted are a relatively recent phenomenon. As a mother of three very different gifted children, as a former educator and advocate for gifted education, I can attest to the benefits and deficits of these programs. However, despite the varying quality of such programs and their methods of identifying students, they stand head and shoulders above earlier efforts to educate gifted children, since specialized programs simply did not exist. From firsthand experience, I know that many gifted &#x201c;programs&#x201d; consisted primarily of removing the &#x201c;smart&#x201d; kids from the classroom and giving them busywork or enlisting their aid as tutors for the &#x201c;slow&#x201d; kids.<br> &nbsp;<br> If we accept the notion that some children are gifted, then we have to account for what happens to these children when they grow up. After all, it&#x2019;s not as though these former children slough off their giftedness like discarded skin at the age of sixteen or eighteen or twenty-one. Gifted children do grow up, and they become gifted adults. It seems like an obvious comment to make, yet little is written about giftedness and how it applies to adults. So instead of asking if gifted adults exist, we might be better served by asking questions like the following: How many gifted adults are there? What are they doing with their lives? What do we know about how they function in society? What do they have to do to be successful and fully use their abilities? These are all important questions, and it is this initial line of inquiry that led me to more fully investigate the concept of giftedness as it applies to adults.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Romans Commentary</h2><p>This is the latest release in Enduring Word Media&#39;s commentary series by David Guzik.

How can it not. After all, he will have a step-sister, and he and his new family are going to travel around the country so that Blaze and Roger can perform in their band. The band, Match, is all the rage, and the new blended family are going to be in the limelight. What he does not expect is that he is also going to be catapulted into the world of spies, lies, and subterfuge. <p> The tour begins right after the wedding, and all goes well at first as the new family begins their drive across the country in the huge tour coach that Roger and Blaze's personal manager arranged for them. Then the coach breaks down and a weathered old roadie called Boone turns up. Boone fixes the coach, and he joins the family on their journey east. </p><p> Soon after they arrive in Philadelphia things start to unravel. Roger and Blaze are busy appearing on shows and are not around much. Q and his new step-sister Angela discover that Boone is not just a roadie and that Angela's mother (whom everyone thought was dead) is alive. Not only that, but a group of Israeli Mossad agents appear to be after her, and they are hoping to get to her using Angela as bait. </p><p> With Boone's spy buddies to help them, Angela and Q try to unravel the past, and at the same time they try to stay ahead of their enemies. </p><p> In this thrilling first title in the I,Q series Roland Smith - who wrote Elephant Run - tells an exciting story that is packed with surprises and colorful characters. Readers who think that it would be easy to be a spy will discover how wrong they were. They will explore a grey world where no one really knows what is going on, and where the righteous do not always win. </p><p> Roland Smith paces the story beautifully, and he leaves his readers in a place that will have them eager to find out what happens next. --Through the Looking Glass, December 2009</p></p><h2>The Little Book of Black Holes (Science Essentials, 29)</h2><p><p><b>Dive into a mind-bending exploration of the physics of black holes</b></p><p>Black holes, predicted by Albert Einstein&#x2019;s general theory of relativity more than a century ago, have long intrigued scientists and the public with their bizarre and fantastical properties. Although Einstein understood that black holes were mathematical solutions to his equations, he never accepted their physical reality&#x2015;a viewpoint many shared. This all changed in the 1960s and 1970s, when a deeper conceptual understanding of black holes developed just as new observations revealed the existence of quasars and X-ray binary star systems, whose mysterious properties could be explained by the presence of black holes. Black holes have since been the subject of intense research&#x2015;and the physics governing how they behave and affect their surroundings is stranger and more mind-bending than any fiction.</p><p>After introducing the basics of the special and general theories of relativity, this book describes black holes both as astrophysical objects and theoretical &#x201c;laboratories&#x201d; in which physicists can test their understanding of gravitational, quantum, and thermal physics. From Schwarzschild black holes to rotating and colliding black holes, and from gravitational radiation to Hawking radiation and information loss, Steven Gubser and Frans Pretorius use creative thought experiments and analogies to explain their subject accessibly. They also describe the decades-long quest to observe the universe in gravitational waves, which recently resulted in the LIGO observatories&#x2019; detection of the distinctive gravitational wave &#x201c;chirp&#x201d; of two colliding black holes&#x2015;the first direct observation of black holes&#x2019; existence.</p><p><i>The Little Book of Black Holes</i> takes readers deep into the mysterious heart of the subject, offering rare clarity of insight into the physics that makes black holes simple yet destructive manifestations of geometric destiny.</p></p><p><p>"<i>The Little Book of Black Holes</i> by Gubser and Pretorius provides an elegantly brief introduction to the basic properties of black holes and their occurrence in the universe. I warmly recommend it to the general reader."<b>--Roger Penrose, author of <i>Fashion, Faith, and Fantasy in the New Physics of the Universe</i></b></p><p>"This timely book provides an excellent summary of what we know about black holes in the universe. Gubser and Pretorius are among the world's most prominent experts on this exciting subject."<b>--Raphael Bousso, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><p>"Entertaining as well as informative. <i>The Little Book of Black Holes</i> is well written, well organized, and enjoyable to read."<b>--Gary Horowitz, University of California, Santa Barbara</b></p><p>"This is a really excellent, beautifully written book. I am not aware of any other book that even approaches a comparably succinct exposition of the physics of black holes."<b>--Sean Hartnoll, Stanford University</b></p>Steven S.

Following a long stint touring the United States and Canada, Scott settled down in Orlando, Florida, where he works on his ongoing comic strip, <i>Basic Instructions</i>. <i>Spell or High Water</i> is his second novel.</p></p><h2>Sundials: Their Theory and Construction</h2><p><p>Have you every wanted to build a sundial or to understand how one works? Then you have probably been frustrated as you search vainly for help. Most books on the subject are either rare out-of-print works published centuries ago and available only in highly specialized collections, or highly complicated treatises whose information is hidden behind frightening arrays of involved formulas. But now your search is over. This book is designed to meet sundialing needs at either the simple or the sophisticated level. <br>Albert E. Waugh, professor and administrator at the University of Connecticut for 40 years, and an expert on the subject of sundials and their curious history, presents, on the one hand, a rigorous appraisal of the science of sundials, including mathematical treatment and an explanation of the pertinent astronomical background; on the other hand, he presents simple and non-technical treatments such that several of the dials can be built by children!<br>The subject matter is arranged in 19 chapters, each covering a different aspect of dialing science. All the common types of dials are covered, but the reader can also learn about analemmatic dials, polar dials, equatorial dials, portable dials, memorial dials, armillary spheres, reflected ceiling dials, cross dials, and old-fashioned noon marks. There are also sections on dial furniture, mottoes, the actual layout out of a dial, the equation of time, finding time in other cities, how to find the meridian, how to find time by moonlight &#x2014; even how to estimate time from the length of one's own shadow! Directions are given for designing dials for any part of the country, or any place in the world. The author has designed many dials, and his text is filled with helpful hints based on his own personal experience. There are over 100 illustrations, charts, and tables, followed by an appendix which is filled with material which reduces or eliminates the need for calculation on the part of the reader. </p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>The Oxford Guide for Writing Tutors: Practice and Research</h2><p><strong>Distinctive Features</strong><br><br>* Includes scholarship authored by undergraduate tutor-researchers<br>* Provides extensive references to and bibliographic citations of the scholarship of the field<br>* Offers references to research that supports and challenges disciplinary common knowledge<br>* Contains assignments designed to support discussion, writing, and inquiry<br></p><p><br><strong>Lauren Fitzgerald</strong> is Director of the Wilf Campus Writing Center and Associate Professor of English at Yeshiva University. <strong>Melissa Ianetta</strong> is Director of the Writing Center and Associate Professor of English at the University of Delaware.

He also stunk. And if it was correct English to say he stinked, then he stinked as well!&#34; It all starts when Chloe makes friends with Mr Stink, the local tramp. Yes, he smells a bit. But when it looks like he might be driven out of town, Chloe decides to hide him in the garden shed. Now Chloe&#39;s got to make sure no one finds out her secret. And speaking of secrets, there just might be more to Mr Stink than meets the eye! or the nose.</p><p>David Walliams - comedian, actor and author - continues to take the children&#39;s literary world by storm. His tenth novel, BAD DAD, was an immediate number one, following the triumph of THE MIDNIGHT GANG, the biggest-selling children&#39;s book of 2016. WORLD&#39;S WORST CHILDREN 2, which published in early 2017, spent four weeks at industry number one and eight weeks at the top of the children&#39;s chart. They have achieved unprecedented critical acclaim - and RATBURGER, DEMON DENTIST and AWFUL AUNTIE have all won the National Book Awards Children&#39;s Book of the Year. David&#39;s books have now exceeded 100 non-consecutive weeks in the children&#39;s number-one spot, and have been translated into 53 languages, selling more than 24 million copies worldwide. Born in London, Tony Ross went to art school in Liverpool. His cartoons have appeared in famous publications the world over. His first book, HUGO AND THE WICKED WINTER, was published in 1972. Tony has since written over 100 books and illustrated over 2000! His creations Towser and The Little Princess have been turned into TV series. David and Tony have worked on six bestselling picture books together, as well as eight of David&#39;s phenomenally successful children&#39;s novels - BILLIONAIRE BOY, GANGSTA GRANNY, RATBURGER, DEMON DENTIST, AWFUL AUNTIE, GRANDPA&#39;S GREAT ESCAPE, THE MIDNIGHT GANG and BAD DAD. David and Tony also collaborated on the 2017 World Book Day title, BLOB, and the two blockbuster short story collections, THE WORLD&#39;S WORST CHILDREN and THE WORLD&#39;S WORST CHILDREN 2.*Starred Review* Not to put too fine a point on it, but Mr. Stink stinks! &#x201c;He was,&#x201d; author Walliams tells us, &#x201c;the stinkiest stinker who ever lived.&#x201d; Why? Well, perhaps it&#x2019;s because he is homeless&#x2014;unless you can call the old wooden bench on which he spends all his time a home. No one ever speaks to him until the day that a sweet-natured little girl named Chloe says hello. This sets in motion a series of often hilariously funny events that involve not only Chloe but her politically ambitious mother, her insufferable younger sister, a pompous television host, and even, yes, the prime minister himself (who turns out to be pretty insufferable, too). Walliams&#x2014;a British comedian-actor-writer&#x2014;has a gift for crafting memorable scenes and, in the person of Mr. Stink, has created a delightfully offbeat character who may have a secret past. The cheerfully rude tone that informs most of his story takes a sharp&#x2014;and rather jarring&#x2014;turn for the sentimental at the end, but young readers won&#x2019;t care, while readers of all ages will be thrilled by the in-a-word perfect illustrations of the great Quentin Blake (who else could draw a picture of stink?). Grades 4-7. --Michael Cart</p><h2>Not a Good Day to Die: The Untold Story of Operation Anaconda</h2><p><b>Award-winning combat reporter Sean Naylor reveals how close American forces came to disaster in Afghanistan against Al Qaida&#x2014;after easily defeating the ragtag Taliban that had sheltered the terrorist organization behind the 9/11 attacks.<br><br></b>At dawn on March 2, 2002, over two hundred soldiers of the 101st Airborne and 10th Mountain Divisions flew into the mouth of a buzz saw in Afghanistan's Shahikot Valley. Believing the war all but over, U.S. military leaders refused to commit the extra infantry, artillery, and attack helicopters required to fight the war's biggest battle&#x2014;a missed opportunity to crush hundreds of Al Qaida's fighters and some of its most senior leaders.<br><br>Eyewitness Naylor vividly portrays the heroism of the young, untested soldiers, the fanaticism of their ferocious enemy, the mistakes that led to a hellish mountaintop firefight, and how thirteen American commandos embodied "Patton's three principles of war"&#x2014;audacity, audacity, and audacity&#x2014;by creeping unseen over frozen mountains into the heart of an enemy stronghold to prevent a U.S. military catastrophe.</p><p><b>Sean Naylor</b>, a senior writer for the&nbsp;<i>Army Times</i>, has covered the Afghan mujahideen's war against the Soviets, and American military operations in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. His coverage of Operation Anaconda earned him the White House Correspondents' Association's prestigious Edgar A. Poe Award. Naylor was named one of the 22 most influential &#x201c;unsung&#x201d; print reporters in Washington by&nbsp;<i>American Journalism Review</i>&nbsp;in May 2002.It was a raw, biting wind that swept down from the Hindu Kush in the first weeks of 2002, and the militiamen guarding the Ariana Hotel in downtown Kabul stamped their feet and blew on their hands to fight off the chill. <p>Behind them the hotel sat squat, yellow, and ugly. The Ariana was owned by the Afghan government, which in reality meant whichever guerrilla army happened to be in charge of Kabul at the time. It also meant the hotel had played several cameo roles in the decade of civil war that had wracked Afghanistan since the pro-Soviet government fell to the mujahideen in 1992. When the Taliban army of fundamentalist Muslim students routed the weak central government in 1996, their first order of business had been to drag Najibullah, the last pro-Soviet Afghan dictator, from the United Nations compound in which he and his brother had sheltered since their government fell in 1992. After torturing them, the Taliban death squad murdered the brothers and then hung their bodies from a makeshift scaffold in the traffic circle in front of the Ariana. Thereafter, the Taliban used the hotel as an R &amp; R spot for troops rotating back from the front line in the war against the Northern Alliance forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud, and as a way station for Pakistani volunteers en route to the front. By way of payback, a Northern Alliance jet dropped a bomb on the hotel in 1997.</p><p>Now the tables had turned again. Al Qaida, the Islamist terrorist organization that had found a welcoming home in Afghanistan under the Taliban, had hijacked four planes in the United States and flown two of them into the World Trade Center and one into the Pentagon, killing thousands and stirring the world&#x2019;s only superpower to action. The Americans had come to Afghanistan, embraced the Northern Alliance, and driven the Taliban from power. And so it was that the guards lounging by the large concrete steps that led up to the Ariana&#x2019;s main entrance were tough-looking Northern Alliance fighters, hard men down from the Panjshir Valley whose fingers never wandered far from the triggers of their Kalashnikov assault rifles. Some of these men had been fighting&#x2014;against the Soviets, Najibullah&#x2019;s regime, other mujahideen militias, and the Taliban&#x2014;for more than twenty years, and it showed on their dark, worn faces and dirty, calloused hands.</p><p>But the balance of power had not shifted completely in the Northern Alliance&#x2019;s favor. Not yet. The big dog on the block was the United States, and so while the Panjshiri guards shivered outside in their motley camouflage uniforms provided by the Central Intelligence Agency, inside the Ariana&#x2019;s bullet-scarred walls the Americans held court. The CIA had rented the entire hotel, retained the staff, and set up its Kabul station there. It made sense for the spooks to use the Ariana. It was centrally located, just a couple of blocks from the Presidential Palace, and the safe house being used by the Special Forces, but it was protected from the busy street by a ten-foot wall. The only other defenses the Americans had added were a string of concertina wire atop the wall and a sandbagged guard post on the flat roof, manned twenty-four hours a day by a couple of Northern Alliance fighters.</p><p>Easy living it wasn&#x2019;t. The plumbing was atrocious, even by Afghan standards, and the hotel was in a general state of disrepair. But it was warm, and the dining room still offered simple but delicious dishes of beans and rice and other staples of Afghan cuisine.</p><p>On this frigid mid-January afternoon a handful of men were gathered in one of the hotel&#x2019;s upstairs rooms for a meeting. The CIA personnel conducted most of their meetings in this room during those first turbulent months after the fall of Kabul, but on this occasion only one agency officer was present&#x2014;a thin, bearded man with long sandy hair called John, who was the deputy chief of station. The rest of the men were soldiers, special operators from the units that had been at the forefront of the war in Afghanistan. Like John, they were dressed in civilian clothes and wore their hair longer than most American soldiers are allowed. All sported the beards that were ubiquitous among American special operators and intelligence operatives in Afghanistan. Most were armed with M4 carbines or 9mm Beretta pistols.</p><p>It was a dark-walled room made even darker by the curtains drawn to prevent any snipers from drawing a bead on those inside. Dust motes swam in a single shaft of intense sunlight that exploited a small gap between the curtains. A lamp resting on an end table cast shadows on a floor covered by an Afghan rug, and the men sat on a tatty, overstuffed sofa and similarly worn but comfortable chairs.</p><p>As the Americans sipped green tea from a service that a member of the hotel staff had set on a glass-topped coffee table, the mood was businesslike. The Taliban had been defeated, the Northern Alliance had swept into Kabul, and the whole country was&#x2014;in theory&#x2014;under the control of the Americans and the Afghan warlords with whom they had allied themselves. But the men in the room were not celebrating. The Taliban were gone and Al Qaida&#x2019;s guerrillas were on the run, but there was still much to do. Six weeks earlier the Americans thought they had Al Qaida&#x2019;s leaders holed up at Tora Bora in the White Mountains that straddle the border with Pakistan. Reluctant to put too many American troops on the ground, U.S. commanders had relied on their Afghan allies backed up by Special Forces to snare Osama bin Laden and his henchmen. But this time the Americans&#x2019; faith in their militia allies was misplaced, and a failure to block escape routes into Pakistan from Tora Bora meant bin Laden and hundreds of Al Qaida&#x2019;s most hardened fighters had slipped the net.</p><p>So long as those guerrillas remained at large, the Americans knew they could not rest. And so as usual in these brainstorming sessions, which John convened daily in his excuse for a sitting room, the talk this afternoon was where to focus next.</p><p>As the meeting was breaking up, John looked across the table and spoke directly to one of the special operators&#x2014;an Army officer dressed in a thick, long-sleeved shirt with an Afghan scarf around his neck. Clipped into the waistband of his cargo pants was a black leather holster in which nestled a semiautomatic Glock pistol with a twenty-round extended clip. Over six feet tall with dark hair and a goatee that framed an open and honest face, the officer was forty years old, yet still had the lean, hard physique of the track and field champion he had been in his youth. He exuded the self-confident air of a man used to not just living but succeeding on his wits. His name was Pete Blaber and he was a lieutenant colonel in 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment&#x2014;Delta, better known to the public as &#x201c;Delta Force.&#x201d;</p><p>The agency was getting a lot of reports that Al Qaida forces were regrouping in a mountainous region south of Gardez in eastern Afghanistan&#x2019;s rugged Paktia province, John said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s it called?&#x201d; Blaber asked. The CIA officer told him. Blaber, who had been in Afghanistan for a month and thought he knew the lay of the land, had never heard of the place. &#x201c;How do you spell it?&#x201d; he said, eyes narrowing with curiosity as he grabbed a mechanical pencil to jot the name down in his day planner.</p><p>As Blaber scribbled, the CIA officer spoke each letter in turn: &#x201c;S-H-A-H-I-K-H-O-T.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The Outsider</h2><p>The seminal work on alienation, creativity, and the modern mind-set. "An exhaustive, luminously intelligent study...a real contribution to our understanding of our deepest predicament."&#x2014;Philip Toynbee.</p><p>Born to a working class English household in 1931,<b> Colin Wilson</b> went from being the "bad boy" of the British literary scene to becoming a wide-ranging historian, novelist, critic, and philosopher. In addition to his classic study of rebellion, <i>The Outsider</i>, Wilson distinguished himself as one of the most prolific and grounded historians of occult and esoteric movements. A rebel until the end, Wilson later in life wrote stirring intellectual defenses of optimism, challenging the dark vogue of figures such as Bertolt Brecht and Samuel Beckett. He died in Cornwall, England, in late 2013.1<br><br>The Country of the Blind<br><br>At first sight, the Outsider is a social problem. He is the hole-in-corner man.<br><br>In the air, on top of a tram, a girl is sitting. Her dress, lifted a little, blows out. But a block in the traffic separates us. The tramcar glides away, fading like a nightmare.<br><br>Moving in both directions, the street is full of dresses which sway, offering themselves airily, the skirts lifting; dresses that lift and yet do not lift.<br><br>In the tall and narrow shop mirror I see myself approaching, rather pale and heavy-eyed. It is not a woman I want-it is all women, and I seek for them in those around me, one by one. . . .<br><br>This passage, from Henri Barbusse's novel L'Enfer, pinpoints certain aspects of the Outsider. His hero walks down a Paris street, and the desires that stir in him separate him sharply from other people. And the need he feels for a woman is not entirely animal either, for he goes on:<br><br>Defeated, I followed my impulse casually. I followed a woman who had been watching me from her corner. Then we walked side by side. We said a few words; she took me home with her. . . . Then I went through the banal scene. It passed like a sudden hurtling-down.<br><br>Again, I am on the pavement, and I am not at peace as I had hoped. An immense confusion bewilders me. It is as if I could not see things as they were. I see too deep and too much.<br><br>Throughout the book, this hero remains unnamed. He is the anonymous Man Outside.<br><br>He comes to Paris from the country; he finds a position in a bank; he takes a room in a "family hotel." Left alone in his room, he meditates: He has "no genius, no mission to fulfill, no remarkable feelings to bestow. I have nothing and I deserve nothing. Yet in spite of it, I desire some sort of recompense." Religion . . . he doesn't care for it. "As to philosophic discussions, they seem to me altogether meaningless. Nothing can be tested, nothing verified. Truth-what do they mean by it?" His thoughts range vaguely from a past love affair and its physical pleasures, to death: "Death, that is the most important of all ideas." Then back to his living problems: "I must make money." He notices a light high up on his wall; it is coming from the next room. He stands on the bed and looks through the spy-hole:<br><br>I look, I see. . . . The next room offers itself to me in its nakedness.<br><br>The action of the novel begins. Daily, he stands on the bed and stares at the life that comes and goes in the next room. For the space of a month he watches it, standing apart and, symbolically, above. His first vicarious adventure is to watch a woman who has taken the room for the night; he excites himself to hysteria watching her undress. These pages of the book have the kind of deliberate sensationalism that its descendants in post-war France were so consistently to be accused of (so that Guido Ruggiero could write: "Existentialism treats life in the manner of a thriller").<br><br>But the point is to come. The next day he tries to recreate the scene in imagination, but it evades him, just as his attempt to recreate the sexual pleasures with his mistress had evaded him:<br><br>I let myself be drawn into inventing details to recapture the intensity of the experience. "She put herself into the most inviting positions."<br><br>No, no, that is not true.<br><br>These words are all dead. They leave untouched, powerless to affect it, the intensity of what was.<br><br>At the end of L'Enfer, its nameless hero is introduced to a novelist who is entertaining the company with an account of a novel he is writing. A coincidence . . . it is about a man who pierces a hole in his wall and spies on all that happens in the next room. The writer recounts all of the book he has written; his listeners admire it: Bravo! Tremendous success! But the Outsider listens gloomily. "I, who had penetrated into the very heart of mankind and returned, could see nothing human in this pantomimic caricature. It was so superficial that it was false." The novelist expounds: "Man stripped of his externals . . . that is what I wish to show. Others stand for imagination . . . I stand for truth." The Outsider feels that what he has seen is truth.<br><br>Admittedly, for us, reading the novel half a century after it was written, there is not so much to choose between the novelist's truth and the hero's. The "dramas" enacted in the next room remind us sometimes of Sardou, sometimes of Dostoevsky when he is more concerned to expound an idea than to give it body in people and events. Yet Barbusse is sincere, and this ideal, to "stand for truth," is the one discernible current that flows through all twentieth-century literature.<br><br>Barbusse's Outsider has all of the characteristics of the type. Is he an Outsider because he's frustrated and neurotic? Or is he neurotic because of some deeper instinct that pushes him into solitude? He is preoccupied with sex, with crime, with disease. Early in the novel he recounts the after-dinner conversation of a barrister; he is speaking of the trial of a man who has raped and strangled a little girl. All other conversation stops, and the Outsider observes his neighbors closely as they listen to the revolting details:<br><br>A young mother, with her daughter at her side, has half got up to leave, but cannot drag herself away. . . .<br><br>And the men; one of them, simple, placid, I heard distinctly panting. Another, with the neutral appearance of a bourgeois, talks commonplaces with difficulty to his young neighbor. But he looks at her as if he would pierce deeply into her, and deeper yet. His piercing glance is stronger than himself, and he is ashamed of it. . . .<br><br>The Outsider's case against society is very clear. All men and women have these dangerous, unnamable impulses, yet they keep up a pretense, to themselves, to others; their respectability, their philosophy, their religion, are all attempts to gloss over, to make look civilized and rational something that is savage, unorganized, irrational. He is an Outsider because he stands for Truth.<br><br>That is his case. But it is weakened by his obvious abnormality, his introversion. It looks, in fact, like an attempt at self-justification by a man who knows himself to be degenerate, diseased, self-divided. There is certainly self-division. The man who watches a woman undressing has the red eyes of an ape; yet the man who sees two young lovers, really alone for the first time, who brings out all the pathos, the tenderness and uncertainty when he tells about it, is no brute; he is very much human. And the ape and the man exist in one body; and when the ape's desires are about to be fulfilled, he disappears and is succeeded by the man, who is disgusted with the ape's appetites.<br><br>This is the problem of the Outsider. We shall encounter it under many different forms in the course of this book: on a metaphysical level, with Sartre and Camus (where it is called Existentialism), on a religious level, with Boehme and Kierkegaard; even on a criminal level, with Dostoevsky's Stavrogin (who also raped a small girl and was responsible for her death). The problem remains essentially the same; it is merely a question of discounting more or less as irrelevant.<br><br>Barbusse has suggested that it is the fact that his hero sees deeper that makes him an Outsider; at the same time, he states that he has "no special genius, no message to bestow," etc., and from his history during the remainder of the book, we have no reason to doubt his word. Indubitably, the hero is mediocre; he can't write for toffee, and the whole book is full of clich�s. It is necessary to emphasize this in order to rid ourselves of the temptation to identify the Outsider with the artist, and so to oversimplify the question: disease or insight? Many great artists have none of the characteristics of the Outsider. Shakespeare, Dante, Keats were all apparently normal and socially well-adjusted, lacking anything that could be pitched on as disease or nervous disability. Keats, who always makes a very clear and romantic distinction between the poet and the ordinary man, seems to have had no shades of inferiority complexes or sexual neuroses lurking in the background of his mind; no D. H. Lawrence-ish sense of social-level, no James Joycian need to assert his intellectual superiority; above all, no sympathy whatever with the attitude of Villiers De L'Isle Adam's Axel (so much admired by Yeats): "As for living, our servants can do that for us." If any man intended to do his own living for himself, it was Keats. And he is undoubtedly the rule rather than the exception among great poets. The Outsider may be an artist, but the artist is not necessarily an Outsider.<br><br>What can be said to characterize the Outsider is a sense of strangeness, of unreality. Even Keats could write, in a letter to Browne just before he died: "I feel as if I had died already and am now living a posthumous existence." This is the sense of unreality, that can strike out of a perfectly clear sky. Good health and strong nerves can make it unlikely; but that may be only because the man in good health is thinking about other things and doesn't look in the direction where the uncertainty lies. And once a man has seen it, the world can never afterward be quite the same straightforward place. Barbusse has shown us that the Outsider is a man who cannot live in the comfortable, insulated world of the bourgeois, accepting what he sees and touches as reality. "He sees too deep and too much," and what he sees is essentially chaos. For the bourgeois, the world is fundamentally an orderly place, with a disturbing element of the irrational, the terrifying, which his preoccupation with the present usually permits him to ignore. For the Outsider, the world is not rational, not orderly. When he asserts his sense of anarchy in the face of the bourgeois' complacent acceptance, it is not simply the need to cock a snook at respectability that provokes him; it is a distressing sense that truth must be told at all costs, otherwise there can be no hope for an ultimate restoration of order. Even if there seems no room for hope, truth must be told. (The example we are turning to now is a curious instance of this.) The Outsider is a man who has awakened to chaos. He may have no reason to believe that chaos is positive, the germ of life (in the Kabbala, chaos-tohu bohu-is simply a state in which order is latent; the egg is the "chaos" of the bird); in spite of this, truth must be told, chaos must be faced.<br><br>The last published work of H. G. Wells gives us an insight into such an awakening. Mind at the End of Its Tether seems to have been written to record some revelation:<br><br>The writer finds very considerable reason for believing that within a period to be estimated by weeks and months rather than by aeons, there has been a fundamental change in the conditions under which life-and not simply human life but all self-conscious existence-has been going on since its beginning. If his thinking has been sound . . . the end of everything we call life is close at hand and cannot be evaded. He is telling you the conclusions to which reality has driven his own mind, and he thinks you may be interested enough to consider them, but he is not attempting to impose them on you.<br><br>This last sentence is noteworthy for its curious logic. Wells's conviction that life is at an end is, as he says, a "stupendous proposition." If it is true, then it negates the whole pamphlet; obviously, since it negates all life and its phenomena. Vaguely aware of the contradiction, Wells explains that he is writing "under the urgency of a scientific training that obliged him to clarify the world and his ideas to the limits of his capacity."<br><br>His renascent intelligence finds itself confronted with strange, convincing realities so overwhelming that, were he indeed one of those logical, consistent people we incline to claim we are, he would think day and night in a passion of concentration, dismay and mental struggle upon the ultimate disaster that confronts our species. We are nothing of the sort. We live with reference to past experience, not to future events, however inevitable.<br><br>In commenting on an earlier book called The Conquest of Time, Wells comments: "Such conquest as that book admits is done by time rather than man."<br><br>Time like an ever rolling stream bears all its sons away<br><br>They fly forgotten as a dream dies at the opening day.<br><br>This is the authentic Shakespearian pessimism, straight out of Macbeth or Timon. It is a surprising note from the man who had spent his life preaching the credo: If you don't like your life you can change it: the optimist of Men Like Gods and A Modern Utopia. Wells declares that, if the reader will follow him closely, he will give the reason for this change of outlook:<br><br>The reality glares coldly and harshly upon any of those who can wrench their minds free . . . to face the unsparing question that has overwhelmed the writer. They discover that a frightful queerness has come into life. . . . The habitual interest of the writer is his critical anticipation. Of everything he asks: To what will this lead? And it was natural for him to assume that there was a limit set to change, that new things and events would appear, but that they would appear consistently, preserving the natural sequence of life. So that in the present vast confusion of our world, there was always the assumption of an ultimate restoration of rationality. . . . It was merely the fascinating question of what forms the new rational phase would assume, what over-man, Erewhon or what not would break through the transitory clouds and turmoil. To this the writer set his mind.<br><br>He did his utmost to pursue that upward spiral . . . toward their convergence in a new phase in the story of life, and the more he weighed the realities before him, the less he was able to detect any convergence whatever. Changes had ceased to be systematic, and the further he estimated the course they seemed to be taking, the greater the divergence. Hitherto, events had been held together by a certain logical consistency, as the heavenly bodies have been held together by gravitation. Now it is as if that cord had vanished, and everything was driving anyhow to anywhere at a steadily increasing velocity. . . . The pattern of things to come faded away.</p><h2>Daring to Love: Move Beyond Fear of Intimacy, Embrace Vulnerability, and Create Lasting Connection</h2><p><p><b>When it comes to finding love, are you standing in your <i>own</i> way? <i>Daring to Love</i> will help you identify the internal barriers that cause you to sabotage your love life, open yourself up to vulnerability, and build the intimate, lasting relationship you truly desire.</b></p><p>After a breakup, most of us spend a lot of time thinking long and hard about what the <i>other</i> person did to cause it, rather than reflecting on ourselves. It seems self-evident that we want our romantic relationships to work, and that love and long-term commitment are our ultimate goals. But what if our desire for love is actually not as straightforward as our emotions make us believe? What if, instead of pursuing love, we are unconsciously pushing it away?</p><p>In <i>Daring to Love</i>, Tamsen and Robert W. Firestone offer techniques based in Robert Firestone&#x2019;s groundbreaking voice therapy&#x2014;the process of giving spoken word to unhealthy patterns&#x2014;to help you understand how <i>you</i> are getting in your own way on the quest for true love. Love, the Firestones argue, makes us vulnerable and triggers old defenses we formed in childhood, causing us to sabotage our relationships in myriad subtle&#x2014;and not-so-subtle&#x2014;ways. Using the voice therapy strategies in this book, you will be able to identify your own defensive patterns and uncover the destructive messages your critical inner voice is telling you about yourself, your partners, and your relationships.</p><p>If you&#x2019;re struggling to cultivate lasting relationships, this book can help you embark on your next romantic journey with more openness and self-knowledge.</p></p><p><p><b>Tamsen Firestone</b> is founder and editor-in-chief of www.psychalive.org, an online mental health resource visited by millions of people each year.

Zen appealed to Greenwood because of its all-encompassing approach to life and how to live it, its willingness to face life&#x2019;s big questions, and its radically simple yet profound emphasis on presence, reality, the now. At the monastery, she also discovered an affinity for working in the kitchen, especially the practice of creating delicious, satisfying meals using whatever was at hand &#x2014; even when what was at hand was bamboo. Based on the philosophy of <em>oryoki</em>, or &#x201c;just enough,&#x201d; this book combines stories with recipes. From perfect rice, potatoes, and broths to hearty stews, colorful stir-fries, hot and cold noodles, and delicate sorbet, Greenwood shows food to be a direct, daily way to understand Zen practice. With eloquent prose, she takes readers into monasteries and markets, messy kitchens and predawn meditation rooms, and offers food for thought that nourishes and delights body, mind, and spirit.</p><p><strong>Gesshin Claire Greenwood</strong> is the author of <em>Bow First, Ask Questions Later </em>and the popular blog <em>That&#x2019;s So Zen</em>.

Based on diaries, letters, and poetry, among other original documents, the research traces the women's lives in sharp detail. Charity Bryant was born in 1777 to a consumptive mother who died a month later. Raised in Massachusetts, Charity developed into a brilliant and strong-willed woman with a passion for her own sex. After being banished from her family home by her father at age twenty, she traveled throughout Massachusetts, working as a teacher, making intimate female friends, and becoming the subject of gossip wherever she lived. At age twenty-nine, still defiantly single, Charity visited friends in Weybridge, Vermont. There she met Sylvia Drake, a pious and studious young woman whose family had moved to the frontier village after losing their Massachusetts farm during the Revolution. The two soon became so inseparable that Charity decided to rent rooms in Weybridge. Sylvia came to join her on July 3, 1807, commencing a forty-four year union that lasted until Charity's death. <br><br>Over the years, the women came to be recognized as a married couple, or something like it. Charity took the role of husband, and Sylvia of wife, within the marriage. Revered by their community, Charity and Sylvia operated a tailor shop employing many local women, served as guiding lights within their church, and participated in raising more than one hundred nieces and nephews. Most extraordinary, all the while the sexual potential of their union remained an open secret, cloaked in silence to preserve their reputations. The story of Charity and Sylvia overturns today's conventional wisdom that same-sex marriage is a modern innovation, and reveals that early America was both more diverse and more accommodating than modern society imagines.<br></p><p><br><strong>Rachel Hope Cleves</strong> is Associate Professor of History at the University of Victoria.

We then move back and forth in narrative, but Cleves never lets us forget the time and space that her subjects inhabited, the social mores, the historical aspects, nor the seemingly-inconsistent attitudes toward romance and sex that our forebears held and that which we've been led to believe they had.

However, the convergence of these topics has, to date, been covered only minutely. <em>Solution-Focused Brief Therapy with Clients</em> <em>Managing Trauma</em> is a comprehensive overview of how Solution Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT) can be used as a treatment approach for working with clients managing various forms of trauma. It includes an overview of SFBT's basic tenets, a description of the current research supporting SFBT as an evidence-based practice, and a comparison of how SFBT clinicians may approach trauma cases differently than clinicians from other therapeutic approaches. The bulk of the text uniquely includes chapters contributed by skilled SFBT clinicians, with differing clinical expertise, sharing their knowledge and describing their strength-based, resiliency focus of applying SFBT in different traumatic circumstances. Practitioners and even Master's/doctoral students will find this text invaluable in learning how to best help traumatized clients develop a positive future and move toward healing and health.<br></p><p><br>Adam Froerer, PhD, MEd, Master of Family Therapy Associate Program Director and Associate Professor, School of Medicine, Mercer University Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences<br><br>Jacqui von Cziffra-Bergs, DEd, MEd, Director, Solution Focused Institute of South Africa<br><br>Johnny Kim, PhD, MSW, Associate Professor, University of Denver Graduate School of Social Work<br><br>Elliott Connie, PhD, MSc, Founder and President, The Solution Focused University<br><br>"<em>Solution-Focused Brief Therapy with Clients Managing Trauma</em> is a tour de force . . . The chapters, covering everything from warfare to domestic violence, childhood sexual abuse to drug addiction and so much more, are packed with rigorous research from within and well beyond the Solution-Focused field. Microanalysis and neuroscience provide convincing evidence of the processes by which Solution-Focused conversations are able to create new pathways into a client's future; research on hope and resilience buttress the clinical focus on strengths and possibility while the whole book is located within the wider ambit of trauma theories and research." <br>-Chris Iveson, BSc, Co-founder, BRIEF<p></p><br></p><h2>Company of Heroes: My Life as an Actor in the John Ford Stock Company</h2><p>When Harry Carey, Sr., died in 1947, director John Ford cast Carey's twenty-six-year-old son, Harry, Jr., in the role of The Abilene Kid in 3 Godfathers. Ford and the elder Carey had filmed an earlier version of the story, and Ford dedicated the Technicolor remake to his memory.<br><br>Company of Heroes is the story of the making of that film, as well as the eight subsequent Ford classics. In it, Harry Carey, Jr., casts a remarkably observant eye on the process of filming Westerns by one of the true masters of the form. From She Wore a Yellow Ribbon and Wagonmaster to The Searchers and Cheyenne Autumn, he shows the care, tedium, challenge, and exhilaration of movie-making at its highest level. Carey's portrayal of John Ford at work is the most intimate ever written. He also gives us insightful and original portraits of the men and women who were part of Ford's vision of America: John Wayne, Richard Widmark, Henry Fonda, Maureen O'Hara, Ward Bond, Victor McLaglen, and Ben Johnson.<br><br>Funny, insightful, and brutally honest, Company of Heroes is a rip-roaring good read that presents the remarkable life story of Harry Carey, Jr., and his many fine performances.</p><p>Harry Carey, Jr., was born in Saugus, California.

"Our ambition, goal-setting, self-helping, and even our spiritual practices are often driven by the underlying sense that we just aren&#x2019;t enough," writes Limbach. "But what if we could accept ourselves just as we are? Open our hearts and invite our demons to tea?"<br> These demons, Limbach teaches, manifest for many of us as a chronic sense of "not-enoughness," inherited through cultural stories that send us conflicting messages: we&#x2019;re supposed to feel happy and confident, but we&#x2019;re also never quite worthy of those feelings. Using the Four Noble Truths as a guide, Limbach shares meditation practices, personal anecdotes, and traditional Buddhist tales that help us learn to befriend ourselves&#x2015;even the more unsavory bits&#x2015;so we can realize our full potential. A popular mindfulness teacher and emerging voice in modern Buddhism, Limbach brings a playful, fresh, and at times joyfully irreverent tone to walking the Eightfold Path.</p></p><p><p><b>Adreanna Limbach</b><br><b>Adreanna Limbach</b> is a personal coach and a lead meditation instructor at MNDFL, NYC&#x2019;s premier drop-in meditation studio.

These days, she usually is.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you honestly think we&#x2019;d just pretend that nothing happened and go shopping?&#x201d; Her eyes remain focused ahead as she says, &#x201c;I had to get you in the car somehow.&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve seen her pull this same trick on our golden Lab, Bingo.

You know why we&#x2019;re here.&#x201d;<br> <br>When I don&#x2019;t unfasten my seat belt, she reaches over and pushes the release button for me. Her expression is stony, her tone is worn-out. &#x201c;I reported Mr. Philips to the police yesterday. They need your statement, so we are going in there and you are telling them everything right now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But . . .&#x201d; My stomach drops at the same time that heat crawls up my neck. &#x201c;You promised that you wouldn&#x2019;t do this!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I made no such promise, Catherine.&#x201d;<br> <br>Oh, my God . . . I need to warn Scott before she forces me in there.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s like she can read my mind. She snatches my phone from my grasp.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s mine! Give it back!&#x201d; I dive for it, but she holds on to it tight, slapping my hands away.<br> <br>&#x201c;The police will want this for evidence.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s an invasion of my privacy.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m doing my best to put up a calm but defiant front. Inside, I&#x2019;m screaming. Because there is evidence on my phone that I should have deleted. That Scott told me to delete and I assured him that I did, but I haven&#x2019;t yet, not all of it. Not the message where he told me I was beautiful. I love lying in my bed and rereading that one.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just drop this already. Please, Mom. Or how about let&#x2019;s just go to the principal. Let him fire Scott if he thinks he needs to. Okay?&#x201d; I plead.<br> <br>My mom&#x2019;s face contorts. &#x201c;The principal is his father.

The police are investigating.&#x201d; She takes a deep, calming breath. &#x201c;I have an obligation, Cath. This is what good parents are supposed to do when they find out that a thirty-year-old man has taken advantage of their teenage daughter.&#x201d;<br> <br>I squash the urge to roll my eyes. That&#x2019;ll only infuriate her. &#x201c;Nothing happened. And, besides, age of consent is sixteen. Stop making it sound like he&#x2019;s some dirty old man.&#x201d; Scott is fun and handsome and could pass for early twenties. He wears ripped jeans and Vans, rides a motorcycle, and listens to The Hives and Kings of Leon. I&#x2019;m far from the only girl in school to fall for him. I&#x2019;ve been infatuated with him from the very first day I sat down in his class.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s your teacher! And what kind of idiot do you take me for? I know exactly what&#x2019;s going on, so stop lying to me.&#x201d; She reaches for her door handle.<br> <br>And I know I&#x2019;m not going to get anywhere with her by continuing to deny this.<br> <br>&#x201c;But Mom . . .&#x201d; I seize her forearm, feeling the muscles tense beneath my grip. I&#x2019;m fighting to keep my bottom lip from quivering. &#x201c;Please. I love him. And he loves me.&#x201d; He&#x2019;s told me so. Quiet whispers in between stolen kisses after school lets out and he&#x2019;s helping me with my portfolio for college applications. Loud shouts in between our tangled breaths the two nights I&#x2019;ve managed to sneak away and ride my bike to see him.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s the faintest flicker of pity in her eyes before they harden. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re barely seventeen, Cath. It&#x2019;s a crush, that&#x2019;s all. It won&#x2019;t last. It&#x2019;s not real.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, this is different.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever he&#x2019;s told you, whatever promises he has made, they&#x2019;re all lies. You&#x2019;re a pretty, young girl and he will tell you whatever you want to hear if it means he gets sex.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re wrong.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Even if I am, it doesn&#x2019;t matter because you cannot be with him, Catherine!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You are just . . . impossible!&#x201d; I smack the dashboard with my hands, tears of frustration burning my cheeks. She&#x2019;s not listening. She doesn&#x2019;t care how I feel. She doesn&#x2019;t care how happy he makes me.<br> <br>Her eyes are now focused on the windshield, on the thin blanket of snowflakes settling against the glass. The car didn&#x2019;t even have enough time to warm up in the five-minute drive over. &#x201c;One day you&#x2019;ll see that I&#x2019;m right. Until then, you need to stop being so selfish.&#x201d;<br> <br>Selfish! &#x201c;But we aren&#x2019;t hurting anyone!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Really? What do you think this mess is going to do to our family? We all have to live here! And your brother and sister have to go to the same high school. The rumors and the gossip and . . .&#x201d; She heaves a sigh. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure people are already wondering about our parenting abilities. We will be the topic of conversation at every dinner table from Belmont to Sterling after this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, because you reported us!&#x201d; For someone who&#x2019;s so worried about her image, I&#x2019;m surprised she&#x2019;s not just as eager to keep this quiet as Scott and I are.<br> <br>&#x201c;God dammit, Catherine!&#x201d; My mother explodes. &#x201c;You are so desperate to be treated like an adult. Show me you deserve it and start acting like one. Take responsibility for your own actions.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine! I&#x2019;ll end it with him!&#x201d; Even as I shout the words, I know it&#x2019;s an empty promise. I&#x2019;m not ending anything with Scott.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s ending, all right. And one day, when you&#x2019;re a parent, hopefully a long time from now, you&#x2019;ll understand why I&#x2019;m doing this.&#x201d;<br> <br>One day, when you&#x2019;re a parent . . . Next to &#x201c;because I said so,&#x201d; that&#x2019;s her party line. But wasn&#x2019;t she ever seventeen and in love? &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t do this. You&#x2019;re going to ruin his life. What if they put him in jail?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s where he belongs, if he&#x2019;s preying on his students.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not preying on anyone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Please. It&#x2019;s you today, and it&#x2019;ll be some innocent fifteen-year-old tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> <br>I hear what she doesn&#x2019;t say&#x2014;that I&#x2019;m not all that innocent.<br> <br>I huff out a sigh. &#x201c;It was just the once.&#x201d;<br> <br>She shakes her head angrily. &#x201c;Has this been going on since you broke up with that boy?&#x201d;<br> <br>I avert my gaze.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why couldn&#x2019;t you have just stayed with him?&#x201d;<br> <br>What? &#x201c;You hated Ethan!&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve never seen Mom as happy as she was the day I told her that I&#x2019;d dumped my cigarette-smoking, Mohawk-sporting boyfriend of three months, by far my longest relationship before Scott. She didn&#x2019;t even ask why, or if I was okay. She didn&#x2019;t care.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d welcome him back with open arms at this point,&#x201d; she mutters.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want Ethan.&#x201d; I haven&#x2019;t given him a moment&#x2019;s thought since the day I ended things. In hindsight, I don&#x2019;t know what I ever saw in him. He&#x2019;s failing half his classes and will likely still be playing video games and bagging groceries at Weiss in ten years&#x2019; time.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t want him, or any of the other boyfriends I&#x2019;ve been with either. That&#x2019;s what they all are. Boys.<br> <br>Scott is a man, and he makes me feel smart and beautiful and talented. He treats me like we&#x2019;re equals. We talk about everything from art to music to places around the world that he wants me to see with him. He makes me think about my future.<br> <br>Our future.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re moving to Philadelphia after I graduate next year. Scott will get a teaching job there, and I&#x2019;m going to go to college for art. He&#x2019;s been helping me with my portfolio. Mom, you should see it, it&#x2019;s kick-ass.&#x201d; This is the right angle. College is all she talks about at home.<br> <br>Cath, where are you applying?<br> <br>Cath, you won&#x2019;t get in anywhere decent with these grades.<br> <br>Cath, you can&#x2019;t make it without a college education.<br> <br>She sighs, drops her gaze to her lap.<br> <br>&#x201c;I told you, we&#x2019;re in love.&#x201d; I hold my breath. Maybe this is all just a scare tactic. Maybe she&#x2019;ll sigh again and then tell me to put my seat belt back on and&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Get out of the car. They&#x2019;re expecting us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hot tears stream down my cheeks. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s Dad going to do when he finds out that you brought me here?&#x201d; I&#x2019;m grasping at straws now, and we both know it. Mom and Dad were fighting about me behind closed doors last night, so she must have told him her plan. He may have disagreed with her, but even he knew that she&#x2019;d do what she wanted to anyway. That&#x2019;s just how she is.<br> <br>That he wasn&#x2019;t at home this morning is telling. Not that he&#x2019;s around much to begin with.<br> <br>She collects her purse and keys and steps out of the car without a word.<br> <br>I consider holding the door locks down and taking a stance, but I know that it&#x2019;s futile. One way or another, Hildy Wright always gets her way.<br> <br>So I wipe the tears with the back of my hand and throw open the car door. &#x201c;I hate you!&#x201d; I scream, using all my strength and anger to slam the door shut.<br> <br>Maybe I can still run.<br> <br>Can they actually make me talk?<br> <br>Do I need a lawyer?<br> <br>Heavy footfalls crunch in the snow behind me and my back tenses. &#x201c;Everything all right here?&#x201d; Sheriff Kerby asks in his smooth, authoritative voice.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, Marvin. We&#x2019;re just here for Catherine to give her statement.&#x201d; Mom and the sheriff have been in the same bowling league for twenty years. Of course she&#x2019;d go directly to him.<br> <br>I take a deep breath and turn to face the older man, his cheeks rosy from the blistering-cold winter wind. He has a kind smile, but I don&#x2019;t let it fool me. He&#x2019;s about to help my mother ruin my entire life.<br> <br>But the Philipses do have a lot of sway around here, I remind myself. And people love Scott. They loved him back when he was taking the Balsam High baseball team to the state championship, and they love him more now that he gave up a teaching job in Philly to move back home and teach here. Maybe that will be enough to get whatever bullshit charges are coming dropped. Scott said it&#x2019;s technically just a misdemeanor and those get tossed all the time, so maybe nothing big will come of it. Then, we&#x2019;ll have the last laugh. And when I move to Philly with him?<br> <br>My mother will be dead to me.<br> <br>With grim determination and what feels like a lead ball in my stomach, I march up the steps to the station.<br> <br>She&#x2019;s wrong. Scott and I are meant to be together.<br> <br>It is real.<br> <br>And I will never forgive her for this.<br> <br><br> <br>December 2010<br> <br>I sit with my hands folded in front of me, fighting the urge to shrink into my seat as I quietly watch Lou Green drag her pen down the length of my r�sum�. Misty warned me that the owner of Diamonds would seem a bit intimidating, with her stern face and harsh tone.<br> <br>I so desperately need this job that I&#x2019;ve been unsettled by nerves all last night and this morning. By the time I stepped through the diner&#x2019;s doors fifteen minutes ago, overwhelmed by the buzzing voices and clanging pots in the kitchen and the potent smell of hot pancakes and sizzling bacon, my stomach was churning fast enough to make butter.<br> <br>It doesn&#x2019;t help that Lou&#x2019;s interviewing me in a booth, smack-dab in the middle of all the bustle, where countless sets of eyes can survey me with abandon&#x2014;some merely stealing glances, others downright staring.<br> <br>Are they always so interested in potential new staff? Or is it just an interest in me, the high school slut who tried to put Scott Philips in jail?<br> <br>&#x201c;So you have no waitressing experience.&#x201d; Lou says it so bluntly, I can&#x2019;t tell if she&#x2019;s merely stating a fact or pointing out a reason why this interview should end now.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, ma&#x2019;am. But I&#x2019;m a fast learner.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t they all,&#x201d; she murmurs dryly, more to herself. &#x201c;You livin&#x2019; with Misty?&#x201d;<br> <br>I nod. &#x201c;For about three months now.&#x201d; In the apartment she shares with her long-haul-truck-driving father who&#x2019;s home one night a month. I moved out of my parents&#x2019; house on my eighteenth birthday, when my mother could no longer force me to stay. It&#x2019;s her legal duty, after all, to house her children until they reach the age of majority. And Hildy Wright is all about the law.<br> <br>&#x201c;And how&#x2019;s that goin&#x2019;?&#x201d; Lou asks.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; For the most part. Misty isn&#x2019;t the sharpest tool in the shed and she rarely shuts up&#x2014;a nightmare early in the morning when I prefer to drink my coffee in quiet solitude and she&#x2019;s all bubbly. But I can&#x2019;t complain because she&#x2019;s given me a place to live and she&#x2019;ll be the reason I get this job, if I do. Plus, she&#x2019;s pretty much the only friend I have left.<br> <br>From the expression on Lou&#x2019;s face, I can only imagine what she thinks of Misty. Her opinion can&#x2019;t be all bad, though, given she hasn&#x2019;t fired her, and she humored her request to interview me.<br> <br>&#x201c;I see you were a cashier at the Weiss in Balsam, from November of last year until March?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. That&#x2019;s right. Five months.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t a good fit.&#x201d; I swallow the knot that&#x2019;s forming, thinking about the day the manager, Susan Graph, pulled me into her office to hand me my vacation pay and tell me that it would be best if I didn&#x2019;t come in anymore, due to what was going on in my personal life. This, after only a month earlier giving me a glowing employee review. The worst part about it is that I have to shop there because it&#x2019;s the only grocery store in Balsam.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can work any shifts you want. Early mornings, midnights . . . anything.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m trying not to sound too desperate, but I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m succeeding. Then again, maybe employers like desperate employees&#x2014;we&#x2019;ll put up with just about anything. And I will put up with just about anything. Misty makes good money in tips. The kind of money I need so I can save up and get as far away from Balsam County as soon as possible. I&#x2019;ve been waiting for a job opening here for months.<br> <br>&#x201c;How will you get here? Do you have a car?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;With Misty, for now. And I figured I could buy something cheap after a few months.&#x201d; Diamonds is a fifteen-minute drive from Balsam, on Route 33, way too far to bike.<br> <br>Lou&#x2019;s pen shifts back to my education. She frowns. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t finished high school?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br> <br>She peers up at me from behind thick-rimmed glasses, her curly mouse-brown hair framing her face in a short crop. If I had to guess, I&#x2019;d put her in her midfifties, though it&#x2019;s hard to say. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you know how important having your high school diploma is?&#x201d;<br> <br>I swallow against the rising shame. &#x201c;I do, but . . . I decided to take a year off.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d thought of lying about it on my r�sum�, but Misty warned me that Lou&#x2019;d fire me for lying if she ever found out.<br> <br>Pl...</p><h2>HBR Guide to Emotional Intelligence (HBR Guide Series)</h2><p><p><b>Managing the human side of work</b></p><p>Research by Daniel Goleman, a psychologist and coauthor of <i>Primal Leadership</i>, has shown that emotional intelligence is a more powerful determinant of good leadership than technical competence, IQ, or vision.</p><p>Influencing those around us and supporting our own well-being requires us to be self-aware, know when and how to regulate our emotional reactions, and understand the emotional responses of those around us.

I absolutely loved the concept and it took about half a second for my writer brain to kick into gear and ask the simple question: <i>What if ... the classroom exercise became real? </i>While the book does depart from the classroom experience about a quarter of the way through, it is the spark that lit the inspirational flame.<br><br>The use of Twitter as the social media platform was integral to the actual classroom experience and I wanted to retain the use of social media, but didn't want to inadvertently run afoul of trademark restrictions by using Twitter.

The book <i> </i>marked a turning point in Zen literature in its critical reevaluation of the enlightenment experience, which the author believes has often been emphasized at the expense of other important aspects of Zen training. In addition, <i>Zen Training </i> goes beyond the first flashes of enlightenment to explore how one lives as well as trains in Zen. The author also draws many significant parallels between Zen and Western philosophy and psychology, comparing traditional Zen concepts with the theories of being and cognition of such thinkers as Heidegger and Husserl.</p><p>Katsuki Sekida (1893&#x2013;1987) was by profession a high school teacher of English until his retirement in 1945. Zen, nevertheless, was his lifelong preoccupation. He began his Zen practice in 1915 and trained at Empuku-ji in Kyoto and Ryutaki-ji in Mishima, Shizuoka Prefecture. He taught at the Honolulu Zendo and Maui Zendo from 1963 to 1970 and at the London Zen Society from 1970 to 1972."Written by a lay teacher with 60 years of experience in zazan, this book provides everyone from absolute beginner to experienced student with detailed, progressive information and discussion on breathing, posture, distraction, actions of mind, physiology, mood, laughter, kensho, and samadhi."&#x2014;<i>Library Journal </i><br>"An extraordinarily important book.

These questions are organized around three fundamental assumptions that govern the authors&#39; approach to reading the Bible: the biblical texts arise from particular historical, social, and cultural settings: the reader likewise reads from a specific setting; and neither the diversity of the texts nor the multitude of readers stands in isolation one from the other. Tiffany and Ringe here offer an approach to biblical interpretation that takes both the texts and the reading context seriously, guiding and encouraging readers to draw upon the expertise and authority of their own life experiences and contexts. They also recognize that wide-ranging experiences and contexts are necessarily involved in biblical interpretation, showing how critical engagement with those contexts, in all their historical, social, and cultural diversity, is itself an unavoidable and invaluable part of the interpretative process.</p><p>Sharon Ringe is Professor of New Testament at Wesley Theological Seminary, Washington, D.C.

In this passionate paean to the sea and its creatures one of the world&#x2019;s foremost marine conservation biologists tells the story of man and the sea, from the earliest traces of life on earth to the oceans as we know them today.&nbsp;He considers the impact of fishing and ocean acidification, rising tides and warming seas, plastics and shifting currents, and reveals what we must do now to preserve our precious oceans. The struggles of Turtles, Dolphins, Whales and Tuna are relatively well known, but few people appreciate just how much our seas have changed in the last fifty years and how many species are now under acute stress. At once passionate and persuasive, <i>The Ocean of Life</i> will appeal to readers of <i>Four Fish</i> and <i>The Sixth Extinction</i> &#x2013;to those who care about environmental sustainability, and to anyone who loves the sea and its creatures.<br><br> &#x201c;Excellent and engrossing...

Displaying his Victorian class prejudice, despite a lack of motive or evidence, Witherspoon decides the murderer is Slocum's cook, who for unknown reasons left the employ of the Duke of Bedford to work for the doctor.It's up to Mrs. Jeffries to discover the true identity of the murderer. Unconvincing red herrings and cliches abound, and sharp readers will spot the murderer early on--he proves to be the least likely person. Brightwell makes Witherspoon almost overbearingly dumb and puts insufficient effort into the mystery itself, which quickly becomes tedious. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hooray for Birds!</h2><p><b>In an exuberant display of color, Lucy Cousins invites little ones to imagine themselves as brilliant birds.</b><br><br>Birds of all feathers flock together in a fun, rhyme-filled offering by the creator of Maisy.

This exciting body-mind approach to personality has a liberating and positive effect on emotional, physical, and psychic distress. Dr. Alexander Lowen, founder and prime mover of this fast-growing therapy, writes that increased joy and pleasure are possible in every day life through an understanding of how your body functions energetically: how it determines what you feel, think, and do. Dr. Lowen points out that lack of energy is the result of chronic muscular tensions, a condition caused by the suppression of feelings. These tensions can be dissolved through the direct body work in bioenergetic exercise, which restores the potential for living a rich, full life. Dr. Lowen analyzes common physical ailments like headaches and lower back pain and shows how they too can be overcome by releasing the muscular tenstion that create them. Generously illustrated with line drawings of bioenergetic exercises, this book is sure to bring freedom, confidence, and pleasure to thousands of men and women.<p>"In this highly interesting and valuable attempt to restore the body to the mind, Dr. Alexander Lowen sets out in a practically useful way the principles of his new form of psychotherapy. <b>Bioenergetics </b>is destined to become widely influential."<br> &#x2014;Ashley Montagu</p></p><p>Biogenergetics is a dynamic form of therapy based on the teachings of Wilhelm Reith.

It&#x2019;s time to jump in, embrace your inner self, and release the things that are holding you back from wholeness. Enter the <em>Millenneagram.</em><br><br>The Enneagram is an ancient personality typing system that has a sneaky way of revealing who we are and why we do the things we do. Using nine types, it gets to the root of our fears and motivations, unveiling our inner-most selves. </p><p></p><p><em>Millenneagram </em>reinvigorates the Enneagram by putting a modern spin on the classic nine types. Hannah Paasch, creator of the popular #millenneagream threads on Twitter, reveals how this system acts as a map toward our authentic selves. For Hannah, the Enneagram is not about changing who we are, but rather nurturing and loving our whole selves, even the pain in the ass qualities. &#x201c;Only from this position of wholeness, rootedness in who we are, what we believe, and what kind of story we are writing, will we be able to act bravely for the sake of justice and humanity &#x2013; to approach our f*cked-up world with the grounded courage it asks of us.&#x201d;</p><p>With her trademark irreverent humor and empowering affirmations, Millenneagram reframes the classic Enneagram types with a fresh perspective and new names that cut right to the chase: </p><p>#1 The Machine <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m an Enneagram 1 and I Can Fix This!&#x201d;</p><p>#2 The Parent <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m an Enneagram 2 and Can I Get You a Refill?&#x201d;</p><p>#3 The Winner <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m an Enneagram 3 and All I Do Is Win.&#x201d;</p><p>#4 The Tortured Artist <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m an Enneagram 4 and I&#x2019;m Deeper Than You.&#x201d;</p><p>#5 The Detective <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m an Enneagram 5 and I Read an Article About That.&#x201d;</p><p>#6 The Oracle <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m an Enneagram 6 and I&#x2019;m Loyal as Fuck.&#x201d;</p><p>#7 The Party <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m an Enneagram 7 so This Might Be Vodka In My Mug.&#x201d;</p><p>#8 The Dragon <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m an Enneagram 8 so Nice Try, Bitch.&#x201d;</p><p>#9 The Wallflower <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m an Enneagram 9 so Let&#x2019;s Just All Chill Out, Dude.&#x201d;</p><p>A powerful tool for self-discovery (that doesn&#x2019;t take itself too seriously), <em>Millenneagram</em> is an invitation for introspection and growth. Hannah&#x2019;s revamped Enneagram goes beyond simply identifying with a type: it gives us permission to be our truest, enough-as-is, bad-ass selves. </p></p><p><p><strong>HANNAH PAASCH </strong>is the blogger and Twitter influencer behind #millenneagram.

The school Christmas pageant incites all kinds of drama: Sam and Kim both want to play Mary, Brad and Nick get into hijinks with a trampoline on stage, and a boy expresses romantic feelings for Sam. In addition to the drama around the play, adventures with animals including staring down a mountain lion and an ill-fated donkey ride feature in this story. The chapters follow along the calendar for the season of Advent and lead right into preparation for Midnight Mass on Christmas. <br><br> <b>SERIES SUMMARY</b><br><br> Nicolas (Nick) and Samantha (Sam) Perry are twins in the Perry family. They moved with their parents, their brother Andrew, and their sister Lizzy, to Hope Springs in the summer. Hope Springs is a fictional town in the mountains of Colorado. This series presents the adventures of the twins, their family, their friends, and the people they encounter at school, church, and in town. This series presents Catholic culture easily and normally, and provides opportunities for readers to think about the consequences of words and actions. Some of the chapters early in the series appear in the Signs of Grace curriculum, and the Hope Springs universe expands out to McCusker's Blue Christmas, and will be featured in other stories to come. This series is written similarly to the Adventures in Odyssey series and the Magic Tree House series, and is recommended for readers ages seven and up, but can also be read by parents to younger children.</p><p>Paul McCusker is an American writer most widely known for Adventures in Odyssey, but he has worked on many other types of writing projects: novels, plays, musicals, radio dramas, and movie scripts. Paul now writes for the Augustine Institute Radio Theatre productions and the Publishing Department. He is a convert to Catholicism, and lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado with his wife and children.</p><h2>Pure Vanilla: Irresistible Recipes and Essential Techniques</h2><p>Who says vanilla isn&#x2019;t sexy?

The varieties and classes of droids are nearly as infinite as their designated specialties. In this updated and expanded nuts-to-bolts survey, each and every droid receives its due&#x2013;from the simplest drones to the most sophisticated automatons, from heroic protocol model, C-3PO, and his multitasking sidekick, R2-D2, to the insidious Separatist leader General Grievous.

They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness!"--C-3PO to R2-D2<br><br> When Star Wars: A New Hope unspooled across theater screens over two decades ago, the audience's first glimpse of the strange denizens inhabiting this "galaxy far far away" wasn't of a hot-tempered princess or a black-garbed Dark Lord. It wasn't of a self-assured smuggler or a wide-eyed farmboy. It wasn't even of a Jawa, Ewok, or Wookiee. The individuals George Lucas chose to inaugurate his epic space saga looked like a stiff golden statuette and a squat, warbling fireplug. They were droids, and as See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo, the peculiar pair would become one of the most beloved movie duos of all time.<br><br> The word "robot," derived from a Czech term meaning "forced labor," was coined in 1920. It wasn't long before the silver screen took notice. In 1926, Fritz Lang's silent classic Metropolis introduced the first--a statuesque stunner named Maria whose graceful art-deco lines would later help inspire the conceptual design of C-3PO. A number of memorable movie mechanicals followed, including the mute brute Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still, the delightfully deadpan Robby the Robot in Forbidden Planet, HAL 9000, the coldly calculating computer from 2001, and Yul Brynner's turn as a haywire theme-park attraction in Westworld. All were unforgettable characters, but their advanced silicon brains couldn't hide the fact that they were hardware without heart and software without soul. Lacking personalities audiences could identify with, movie robots fell into two neat categories: subservient drones and emotionless menaces.<br><br> Star Wars broke that mold. Artoo and Threepio were bickering buddies more akin to Laurel and Hardy than clockwork and cogwheels. Thanks largely to the men inside the metal, actors Kenny Baker and Anthony Daniels, the droids were just as human as anyone else in the cast--and they got all the best lines, too. Threepio might be a sophisticated translation machine fluent in over six million forms of communication, but it is his exasperated response to a door slamming shut in his face ("how typical!") that elicits a sympathetic laugh. And despite the fact that Artoo could speak only in whistles, sound engineer Ben Burtt created a warmly expressive nonverbal language by mixing synthesized electronic tones with the sound of his own voice.<br><br> See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo may have greeted us at the door, but more droids--many more--waited for us in the dusty corners of Mos Eisley and the cavernous hallways of the Death Star. The movie trilogy's "lived-in" design scheme meant that most of these whirring gadgets had rust spots and flaking paint jobs, but their appearances were always funny, intriguing, and bizarre, from the gleefully sadistic torturer in Jabba the Hutt's boiler room to the marching carton aboard the Jawa sandcrawler that unaccountably blurted out "gonk, gonk."<br><br> The sheer variety of sizes, forms, and appearances hammered home one obvious fact--when folks in the Star Wars universe have a problem, they build a droid. Specialized robots fill every conceivable niche from trash collection to surgery, and it has taken twenty years of novels, comics, computer games, television cartoons, and newspaper strips to showcase their full product range.<br><br> The Essential Guide to Droids is proud to present one hundred of these universal gizmos. We like to think we covered all the cool ones.<br><br> Daniel Wallace<br> Detroit, Michigan<br><br> <b>A GUIDE TO MAJOR MANUFACTURERS</b><br><br> Droids are intelligent mechanical contraptions that are vital to the smooth operation of galactic society. Every day, millions of subservient automatons negotiate treaties, repair hyperdrives, cure plagues, incinerate garbage, nurse children, haul cargo, deliver messages, cook meals, and kill enemies. At the same time, droids are often ignored and unappreciated, treated as chattel by many owners and looked at with outright hostility by others. Though antidroid prejudice is a reality among the unenlightened, the few owners who have spent long stretches of time with their droids have discovered that they can be trusted companions and loyal friends.<br><br> Unlike machines, all droids possess intelligence to some degree. Unlike computers, most droids are designed for mobility on limbs, wheels, or antigravity fields. The manufacture and sale of droids is a lucrative business dominated by the "Big Two"--Cybot Galactica and Industrial Automaton. Other major droid players include Arakyd Industries, Genetech Corporation, MerenData, and Veril Line Systems.<br><br> Of the millions of droid manufacturing plants in the galaxy, the two largest are Mechis III and Telti, which together produce a sizable percentage of all new automatons. Both locations are entire worlds covered with sprawling construction facilities and fully automated assembly lines; any human interaction in the fabrication process other than the most minimal supervision is unnecessary and counterproductive. The major droid companies pay these two worlds a negotiated fee for the use of their assembly plants, a cost that is acceptable given the speed and accuracy with which they can churn out large orders. Arakyd Industries, Genetech Corporation, SoroSuub Corporation, and Veril Line Systems are some of the companies that employ Mechis III for a major share of their production. Industrial Automaton and Cybot Galactica rely heavily on Telti. The novice Jedi Knight Brakiss recently served as manager of the Telti plants, while Mechis III is currently operated by the Thul family of Alderaan.<br><br> In addition to the more common droids produced by major manufacturers, there are many mechanicals that are difficult to classify for a number of reasons. Some droids are so ancient that verifiable information on their manufacture has been lost in the fog of history. Some are unique creations concocted by ingenious, oddball inventors, yet others are products of restricted alien governments.<br><br> <i>Manufacturers</i><br><br> <b>Accutronics</b><br><br> Accutronics, a former subsidiary of Industrial Automaton, was an early forerunner in the marketing of droids to families with young children. Their remarkable success in persuading the public to view metallic machines as loving caregivers has allowed the company to move out from IA's shadow and become the leader in their niche. Accutronics' corporate headquarters is located on Eriadu and its satellite offices are found throughout the Outer Rim.<br><br> Model E<br> TDL Nanny Droid<br><br> <b>Arakyd Industries</b><br><br> The rise of the militaristic Empire was very good for Arakyd Industries. Through political maneuvering and competitive infighting the company set itself up as the only logical choice to receive the first Imperial droid contracts; they shrewdly exploited this early windfall by working hard to become the galaxy's leading military supplier. Recent consumer-market models from Arakyd have been moderately successful, but only account for a small fraction of their total yearly output. Despite the company's past history, the New Republic has worked closely with Arakyd since the collapse of Imperial rule.<br><br> Death Star Droid<br> G-2RD Guard<br> Mark X Executioner<br> Seeker Messenger Droid<br> Moon Moth<br> Tracker Droid<br> Probot Series<br> <b>Balmorran Arms</b><br><br> Balmorra, home to Balmorran Arms, is an ancient factory world at the edge of the Core. The Empire used the planet's huge assembly plants to churn out the majority of its AT-ST scout walkers, but Balmorra's master weaponsmiths also designed several unique tools, including the SD-9 and SD-10 robotic infantry soldiers, for Emperor Palpatine. During the rampages of the resurrected Emperor, Governor Beltane introduced the X-1 Viper in the hopes of freeing his people from Imperial rule.<br><br> SD-9 and SD-10<br> X-1 Viper ("Automadon")<br> <b>Corellian Engineering Corporation</b><br><br> Corellian Engineering Corporation (CEC) is one of the galaxy's three largest starship manufacturers and arguably the most respected. In addition to blockade runners and light freighters, CEC manufactures the droid-based StarHauler cargo barge. Though the company has taken steps to prevent it, many of their products are stolen by criminals and refitted into deadly robot ramships.<br><br> Drone Barge<br> Robot Ramship<br> <b>Corporate Sector Authority</b><br><br> The Corporate Sector Authority (CSA) is the ruling administration in the Corporate Sector, a free-enterprise profit center that was nominally controlled by the Empire during Palpatine's reign. Since the rise of the New Republic the CSA has remained aloof and reluctant to form political alliances. The region is a thriving and diverse manufacturing center, exporting thousands of new and innovative products to the greater galaxy each year.<br><br> CD-2 Harvester<br> Firefighting Robo<br> <b>Cybot Galactica</b><br><br> One of the two largest droid manufacturers in the galaxy--Industrial Automaton is the other--Cybot Galactica is a major force in the galactic economy and a significant influence throughout the Core Worlds and Corporate Sector.

Claiming Geentech's similar name infringed on their own copyrights, Genetech forced their competitor into bankruptcy and, though these allegations have never been proven, might even have offered Imperial prosecutors a lucrative trade inducement to ensure their victory. Geentech's sole success story, the 2-1B Surgical Droid, was subsequently bought out by Industrial Automaton.<br><br> 2-1B Surgical Droid<br> <b>Genetech Corporation</b><br><br> One of the older and larger droid manufacturers, Genetech Corporation started out as a pharmaceutical firm. The company pioneered the concept of using droids to streamline the manufacturing process, which earned them a great deal of ill-will--and fueled the antidroid movement--when thousands of assembly workers were fired from their jobs. Genetech's first droids were medical units, but the company has since branched out into accounting, administrative, and bookkeeping models.<br><br> Systems Control Droid<br> 3D-4X Administrative</p><h2>The Magnificent Book of Ocean Creatures</h2><p><i>The Magnificent Book of Ocean Creatures</i> introduces young readers to the diversity of marine life through stunning, oversized illustrations and fascinating facts.<br><br>The world's oceans are teeming with amazing animals, and <i>The Magnificent Book of Ocean Creatures</i> brings this undersea world into the reader's hands with dazzling, oversized illustrations and captivating facts.

Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J.K. Rowling's enchanting, funny debut novel, <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>. In the nonmagic human world--the world of "Muggles"--Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, curiously refined sensibilities, and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he's quite, yes, altogether different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, piglike cousin Dudley. <p> A mysterious letter, delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid, wrenches Harry from his dreary, Muggle-ridden existence: "We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry." Of course, Uncle Vernon yells most unpleasantly, "I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!" Soon enough, however, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts with his owl Hedwig... and that's where the real adventure--humorous, haunting, and suspenseful--begins. <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>, first published in England as <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</i>, continues to win major awards in England. So far it has won the National Book Award, the Smarties Prize, the Children's Book Award, and is short-listed for the Carnegie Medal, the U.K. version of the Newbery Medal. This magical, gripping, brilliant book--a future classic to be sure--will leave kids clamoring for <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i> and <i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i>. (Ages 8 to 13) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>The beloved first book of the Harry Potter series, now fully illustrated by award-winning artist Jim Kay. For the first time, J. K. Rowling&#39;s beloved Harry Potter books will be presented in lavishly illustrated full-color editions. Rowling herself selected artist Jim Kay, whose over 100 illustrations make this deluxe format as perfect a gift for the child being introduced to the series as for the dedicated fan. Harry Potter has never been the star of a Quidditch team, scoring points while riding a broom far above the ground. He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a dragon, and has never worn a cloak of invisibility. All he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley - a great big swollen spoiled bully. Harry&#39;s room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn&#39;t had a birthday party in eleven years. But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to an incredible place that Harry - and anyone who reads about him - will find unforgettable.</p><h2>Cheyenne Again</h2><p>In the late 1880s, a Cheyenne boy named Young Bull is taken from his parents and sent to a boarding school to learn the white man's ways. "Young Bull's struggle to hold on to his heritage will touch children's sense of justice and lead to some interesting discussions and perhaps further research." &#x2014;School Library Journal</p><p><p>Eve Bunting has written&nbsp;over two hundred&nbsp;books for children, including the Caldecott Medal-winning <i>Smoky Night,</i> illustrated by David Diaz, <i>The Wall</i>,<i> Fly Away Home</i>, and <i>Train to Somewhere</i>. She lives in Southern California.</p>Grade 1-4-A poignant look at the pain inflicted upon one child by a dominant culture's heavy-handed attempt to "help." Near the turn of the century, a Cheyenne boy, Young Bull, is forced to attend the off-reservation Indian school so that he can learn to become a part of the white world. He is housed in soulless barracks and shown repeatedly and quite blatantly that the Indian ways are no good. When he rebels and tries to run home in a snowstorm, he is caught, returned, and shackled for a day. The story, told from Young Bull's point of view, is not so much judgmental as empathetic-none of the authority figures is an ogre. The agents for change here are not white bureaucrats, but Indians who have adopted white ways, and Young Bull clearly feels betrayed by them. Toddy's acrylic and oil paintings add to the emotions expressed in the narrative. The openness, light, color, and individuality of the boy's home surroundings are in sharp contrast to the formality, emptiness, and uniformity of the school. Young Bull's struggle to hold onto his heritage will touch children's sense of justice and lead to some interesting discussions and perhaps further research.<br><i>Sally Margolis, formerly at Deerfield Public Library, IL</i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The New Honey Revolution</h2><p>The Definitive Book on the Health Benefits of HONEY New information from current research - New amazing facts Restoring the health of future generations is more than a hopeful promise or a clever slogan.

Professionals, however, cannot arbitrarily select which policy to follow in any circumstance. Knowing what comprises a given policy is essential, but equally important is understanding how to amend a policy by applying unique skills that reflect the social work profession's shared values and beliefs. Recognizing that a series of interdependent social policies govern every aspect of social work in both nonprofit and public organizations, this practice-specific textbook focuses on influencing social policies in an agency setting or through formal governmental processes. Purposefully, the Handbook also relies on information comes from the digital world; using the web as a primary source builds on the social work profession's long-held belief to "begin where the client is." Using the links to the various data and citation sources, readers will learn to identify and discern the features of a valid web site. As a whole, The Handbook of Policy Practice is an essential resource for all BSW and MSW students.<br></p><p><br>Ira C. Colby, DSW, MSW, is Professor Emeritus at the University of Houston. Dr. Colby describes his social work career as one of discovery, passion, concern for others, and civic engagement. His political beginnings began as a youngster when he volunteered in a neighbor's campaign for a local city council seat. Over the years, his political work led him to: participate in and lead local, state, and national advocacy efforts and groups; provide testimony to numerous local, state, and national legislative groups; and chair a political campaign. His global-to-local perspective has been enhanced by his travel and international work to more than 25 countries.<br><br>"Ira C. Colby's <em>The Handbook of Policy Practice</em> is a 'hands-on' practice textbook that explores ways to influence social policy . . . It offers a common-sense approach to issue analysis with added attention to the concept of social justice and necessary critical thinking skills, policy analysis, history, economics, politics, ideologies and values, and alternate policy models. <br> <br>Examples used will assist readers as they endeavor to analyze historical and current social welfare policies in light of the principles of social and economic justice and human rights; and understand the role of power and privilege in social welfare policy, especially as it pertains to equality, equitability, and discrimination based on race, ethnicity, age, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, class, disability, and other individual and population characteristics." <br> <br>- Gary Bailey, DHL, MSW, ACSW, Professor of Practice, Simmons College School of Social Work <br><p></p><br>"Social work students seeking to understand social policy have an outstanding new book to help. Colby's <em>The Handbook of Policy Practice</em> draws on his decades of teaching and own successful policy practice experience to provide a top-notch addition to the field. The book encourages active application of material through targeted skill-building activities, turning everyone into experienced policy practitioners, one chapter at a time. In short, this book is an exciting resource for social policy courses and for helping social work students fulfill their ethical obligations in bringing change to society.

The novel&#x2019;s iconic hero, Ostap Bender, an unemployed con artist living by his wits, joins forces with Ippolit Matveyevich Vorobyaninov, a former nobleman who has returned to his hometown to look for a cache of missing jewels hidden in chairs that have been appropriated by the Soviet authorities. The search for the chairs takes them from the provinces of Moscow to the wilds of the Transcaucasus mountains. On their quest they encounter a variety of characters, from opportunistic Soviet bureaucrats to aging survivors of the old propertied classes, each one more selfish, venal, and bungling than the last.

In these pages, parents reconcile with children, embittered siblings reconnect, angry friends reunite, and war veterans and crime victims meet with their enemies. Davis weaves these powerful accounts with her own experiences reconciling with her mother after a long, painful estrangement.</p> <p>Making a crucial distinction between reconciliation and forgiveness, Davis explains how people can make peace in relationships without necessarily forgiving past hurts.

After experiencing mixed results and a life of deprivation that seemed unsustainable at best, she adopted 12 of her own wellness directives&#x2014;including eliminating sugar, switching to all-natural beauty products, and getting in touch with her spiritual side&#x2014;to find out which lifestyle changes truly impacted her health for the better. The Wellness Project is the insightful and hilarious result of that year of exploration&#x2014;part memoir and part health and wellness primer (complete with 20 healthy recipes), it&#x2019;s a must-read not just for those suffering from autoimmune disease, but for anyone looking for simple ways to improve their health without sacrificing life&#x2019;s pleasures.</p><p><b>Phoebe Lapine</b> is a food and health writer, gluten-free chef, wellness personality, culinary instructor, speaker, and author of the award-winning blog,&nbsp;Feed Me Phoebe, where she shares recipes for healthy comfort food and insights about balanced lifestyle choices beyond what&#x2019;s on your plate.&nbsp;Lapine is a regular contributor to <i>Mind Body Green, The Huffington</i>&nbsp;<i>Post</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Food &amp; Wine</i>, among other publications.&nbsp;<i>Feed Me</i>&nbsp;<i>Phoebe&nbsp;</i>was a finalist in the&nbsp;<i>Saveur&nbsp;</i>Blog Awards 2015. She lives in New York.<i>If you could tell someone to make just </i>one <i>lifestyle change that would have a profound effect on their general well-being, what would it be?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> The answers I got to my One Big Question (henceforth referred to as the OBQ) were surprising. People stopped talking about SoulCycle and superfoods and started talking about the bigger picture.<br> &nbsp;<br> With these responses, I started designing a set of short-term challenges to help me tackle each of my problem areas, one by one. The idea was to dedicate a year to overhauling my health&#x2014;like Gretchen Rubin did for her happiness&#x2014;with experiments for everything from cleaning up my makeup to forming better hydration habits to feeding my microbiome.<br> &nbsp;<br> And thus <i>The Wellness Project </i>was born.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I started talking about my project with friends and the readers of my blog, <i>Feed Me Phoebe</i>, it became clear that &#x201c;wellness&#x201d; was a rather polarizing term. While many said that they embraced it, others reported that they felt the word was elitist and had come to stand for hundred-dollar-a-day juice cleanses and designer yoga mats instead of integrative health.<br> &nbsp;<br> I needed to settle on a definition outside the modern marketing machine, and the one that spoke to me most was from the National Wellness Institute. It states that wellness is &#x201c;an active process of becoming aware of and making choices toward a more successful existence.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I liked this idea of an <i>active process</i>&#x2014;that wellness itself was a journey, not a destination. Because what I&#x2019;d found that so many health experts, and even my own physicians, fail to acknowledge is that change is pretty fucking hard.<br> &nbsp;<br> The struggle is <i>real</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ninety-two percent of people who set New Year&#x2019;s resolutions in 2014 failed to keep them. Why? One reason might be because the objectives were too ambitious. With so many new rules added to the mix every year&#x2014;usually, the villainizing of one ingredient or another&#x2014;it&#x2019;s all too easy to throw fifteen balls (or organic apples) in the air and watch them come crashing down.<br> &nbsp;<br> Working as a culinary instructor had shown me firsthand the failures that can result in the kitchen when you bite off more than you can chew, and tackling these &#x201c;life recipes&#x201d; would be no different. I had already struggled to implement the far-reaching advice that my doctor had handed to me without a road map. The grander my intentions, the more I would need a framework for execution.<br> &nbsp;<br> And without one, the more likely I would be to end up with organic applesauce all over the floor.<br> &nbsp;<br> The American Psychological Association recommends that you approach lifestyle changes in baby steps, one habit at a time. So for my wellness curriculum, I decided to compartmentalize my endeavors as much as I could. Like the 92 percent of well-meaning Americans, I had already<br> tried to do too much at one time and felt like a failure when overwhelm set in and, instead, I did nothing at all. Isolating each change would help me measure its true impact and see which ones were worth the time, money, and energy going forward.<br> &nbsp;<br> I ruled out prohibitions that were too crazy or unrealistic. For example, I wasn&#x2019;t going to throw out my entire wardrobe because the clothes contained toxic dyes. Everyone has a limit or an exemption clause, and I put my peep toe&#x2013;heeled foot down at wearing a shapeless hemp tunic down Fifth Avenue.<br> &nbsp;<br> To get the most difficult stuff out of the way, while my resolve was at its firmest, I would start by confronting my three biggest vices: sugar, caffeine, and alcohol. Since the state of my skin was one of my chief barometers for success, I would explore greener ways to care for it next. And because our food choices loom the largest, I knew I needed to figure out once and for all what rules should prevail in the kitchen.<br> &nbsp;<br> Water, sleep, and exercise were basic imperatives that came up again and again in the answers to my OBQ, and they too would get a deeper dive. I blamed my failure on the fitness front on back pain and digestion problems, so I knew that I would have to tackle those two issues as well. And part of putting all the pieces of my wellness puzzle together would be to better understand how to support my hormones. Finally, since physical problems are often driven by emotional ones, I would have to get my stress in check. After all, one of my main motivations for taking on this project was that desperately trying to be &#x201c;healthy&#x201d; was causing me anxiety.<br> &nbsp;<br> As for the new rules and routines I would live by, I gave myself the freedom to modify them as I figured out which experiments improved my life and which, despite the best scientific and spiritual intentions, just didn&#x2019;t. I would certainly measure my progress by internal (blood work) and external (skin) evidence of change. But my intention was not to become the healthiest person on the planet. I wanted to discover a new path forward that I could stay on indefinitely, for the long haul.</p><h2>Boundaries of the Soul: The Practice of Jung&#39;s Psychology</h2><p>After thirteen printings and with nearly 100,000 copies in print since its publication twenty years ago, <i>Boundaries Of The Soul</i> has become recognized as THE classic introduction to Jung and the practice of Jung's psychology.&nbsp;&nbsp;The book has been described as "the clearest and most coherent exposition of Jung's total thought," by Robertson Davies, and Alan Watts has called Dr. Singer "one of the great masters of the art." <br><br>Now, in a completely revised edition of <i>Boundaries Of The Soul</i>, Dr. Singer incorporates the latest developments in Jungian psychology over the last two decades, particularlv in the areas of masculine/feminine relationships, the use of psychotherapeutic drugs, and the evolution of Jung's concept and personality types and its application both clinically and in the world of business and industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the case histories, so central to understanding many of Jung's concepts, have been re-examined and revised where necessary to correspond to the spirit of today's world. <br><br>The updated edition of <i>Boundaries Of The Soul</i> should reaffirm the book's long-standing reputation as the best introduction to Jung's thought available.</p><p>"In a way one might say that this book ought not to have been published, because it gives away the essential secrets of psychotherapy and is from the pen of one of the great masters of the art."--Alan Watts<p>"It is so deep and so rich and so lucid."--Anais Nin</p><b>June Singer</b>&nbsp;is a Jungian analyst who has practiced and taught for over thirty years.

Again their time is short, and they spend it reestablishing the connection they experienced on their first meeting.

Inside, passengers sleep, read, and stare out the window. A few walk up and down the aisles. </i><br><i>C00ELINE, a young woman in her mid-twenties, is curled up in her seat </i>reading Georges Bataille's Story of the Eye<i>. Strikingly attractive, she plays it down by wearing no makeup, a loose-fitting vintage dress, and flat shoes. She continues reading while taking an occasional bite of a chocolate bar. Sitting four rows back and on the other side of the aisle, JESSE, also mid-twenties, is engrossed in Klaus Kinski's memoir, </i>All I Need Is Love<i>. Casually good-looking but a little scruffy, he dresses in the jeans and T-shirt mode. Suddenly a couple, two fortyish types who have been arguing semiquietly in the seat behind </i>CELINE<i>, start yelling at each other in German. The </i>WIFE<i> takes a swipe at the newspaper the </i>HUSBAND<i> has been screening himself behind.</i><br>WIFE Will you put down that damn newspaper and listen to me? <br>HUSBAND What've I been doing the last thirty minutes? Would you shut up for Chrissake? <br>WIFE You shut up! How dare you tell me to shut up! It's the same damn thing all over again! I can't believe- <br>HUSBAND I said shut up! I'm putting down my newspaper and telling you to shut up. <br>CELINE <i>suddenly gets up, grabs her bag, and starts looking for another seat. A few rows back, she finds a seat across the aisle from </i>JESSE. <i>Before sitting down, they make brief eye contact and kind of shake their heads and smile at the tension. Just as she settles in and goes back to her book, the </i>WIFE<i> gets up and storms down the aisle. </i>JESSE<i> and</i> CELINE<i> follow her with their eyes, and as she passes them they find they are looking right at each other. He makes a funny "uh-oh" face.</i> <br>JESSE Do you have any idea what they're arguing about? Do you speak English? <br>CELINE Yes. But no, I don't know. My German is not that good. (a beat) Have you ever heard that as couples get older they lose their ability to hear each other? <br>JESSE Really? <br>CELINE Supposedly men lose their ability to hear higher-pitched sounds and women eventually lose hearing on the low end. I guess they sort of nullify each other or something. <br>JESSE Must be nature's way of allowing couples to grow old together and not kill each other, I guess. There's a slightly awkward moment where they don't know if they should continue talking or not. She glances back down at her book but he keeps looking at her. <br>JESSE <i>(continued) </i> What are you reading? She holds up the book so he can see what it is. <br>CELINE How about you? He shows her what he's reading. Neither has much to say about the other's reading material. <br>CELINE <i>(continued)</i> There are so many weird people on the train, no? Last week on my way to Budapest I was sitting and talking with four other people in the lounge car and it turned out that three of them had killed people. <br>JESSE No way. <br>CELINE Really. One was a war veteran, one had murdered her boyfriend, and another had caused a bad car wreck. <br>JESSE So you were the only one who hadn't killed anyone? <br>CELINE No, I was one of them. Which one do you think? She laughs and he slowly joins her. <br>JESSE I know what you mean. I've met some weirdos. There was this British guy sitting across from me the other day who kept throwing his body against the back of his chair, yelling about how we should all join together and stop the train. He was saying, "Everybody, now, we can stop technology. All together . . ." <br>CELINE So what happened? He demonstrates by throwing his body against his seat. <br>JESSE And you know, me and a few others tried for a while, but we couldn't stop technology. <br><i>The</i> WIFE<i> who stormed away earlier suddenly comes back and the argument resumes, right in front of them. </i><br>JESSE <i>(continued) </i> I was thinking about going to the lounge car sometime soon. You wanna go? <br>CELINE We better. They get up and walk to the door of their car. He pushes the door open button, and as the door opens he extends his hand toward her. <br>JESSE Oh, I'm Jesse. It's James, actually, but my whole life everyone's called me Jesse. <br>CELINE So it's Jesse James? <br>JESSE No, just Jesse. <br>CELINE Celine. <br><i>They proceed through the door and </i>CELINE <i>pushes the door open button to enter the next car. There is some confusion as to who is opening the door for whom before </i>CELINE <i>proceeds and </i>JESSE<i> follows her toward the lounge car. </i><br><br>2 <br>INTERIOR: LOUNGE CAR - AFTERNOON <br><i>They sit at a table, eating chips and taking an occasional swig from a drink. </i><br>JESSE So how do you speak such good English? <br>CELINE I went to school for a summer in Los Angeles and I've spent some time in London. How do you speak such good English? <br>JESSE I'm American. <br>CELINE I know. It's a joke. I knew you were American, and, of course, you don't speak any other language. <br>JESSE Yeah, yeah, I'm the dumb, vulgar American who has no culture. But I tried. I want you to know I took four years of French. I tried, I was ready. When I was in Paris, I was standing in line at the metro going, "Un billet, s'il vous pla�t. Un billet, s'il vous pla�t." And then I got up to the window, I looked at the lady, and blanked out. "Uh, uh, I need a ticket for the subway." No more French for me. <i>(a beat)</i> So where are you headed? <br>CELINE Back to Paris. My class starts next week. <br>JESSE Where do you go to school? <br>CELINE La Sorbonne. You know? <br>JESSE Sure. But you were in Budapest? <br>CELINE Yeah, I was visiting my grandmother. <br>JESSE How is she? <br>CELINE Okay. How about you-where are you going? <br>JESSE Vienna. <br>CELINE What's there? <br>JESSE I don't know. I'm flying out of there tomorrow morning. <br>CELINE Are you on holiday? <br>JESSE I don't know what I'm on. I've just been traveling around the last two or three weeks. <br>CELINE Were you visiting friends, or just going around on your own? <br>JESSE I visited a friend in Madrid for a while, but mostly I've just been . . . <i>(new thought)</i> I got one of those Eurail passes, and you know what's fascinating about traveling around? You spend all this time trying to reach your destination, you get there, you look around, it's never exactly what you'd hoped, you head off somewhere else, and hope for something better. <br>CELINE It's like getting ready for a party, getting there, and falling asleep. That's why when I'm traveling I kind of force myself not to expect anything from anywhere or anyone. And then, whatever happens is a surprise. The most insignificant thing can become an endless subject of interest, no? <br>JESSE That's what I like about traveling-you can sit down, maybe talk to someone interesting, see something beautiful, read a good book, and that's enough to qualify as a good day. You do that at home and everyone thinks you're a bum. <br>CELINE I like that though. But it's like my favorite American writers. They describe everything you wouldn't want to live through, and yet you cannot stop reading of this exciting, boring life. <br>JESSE So what do you study? <br>CELINE Literature. But I haven't decided yet what I really want to do. <br>JESSE Do you want to write? <br>CELINE Yeah, but . . . <i>(new thought)</i> I kind of had this obsession a few years ago about creating a new form of expression. It was of course an abstract and lost quest, but I was feeling all art forms seemed used up. I was especially rejecting words. They seemed so rusted and dirty. And they've been used for such evil ends. Sometimes, you know, language is so limited. It's like . . . if you think about it . . . <i>She holds her hands out fairly wide and round.</i> <br>CELINE <i>(continued)</i> This is an individual's mental experience and perception and . . . <i>She holds her hands together and forms a small circle. </i><br>CELINE <i>(continued)</i> This is how much can be expressed through language. We just don't have words for so many of the impressions we have. She parts her hands and gestures to the large outer circle. <br>CELINE <i>(continued)</i> So most of our life we will never be able to express to anyone. <br><i>They sit there for an extended moment, neither sure what to say next. Suddenly JESSE smiles and jokingly starts to get up.</i> <br>JESSE So I guess . . . that's it-it's been nice not communicating with you. They both laugh. <br>JESSE <i>(continued)</i> Really, though, I basically agree with you, and maybe it's a sad fact of life, but I think it doesn't bother me that much. Maybe I'm wrong about this, but I think that lack of communication frustrates women more than men. <br>CELINE Yes, because men are perfectly content to sit in front of TV all day drinking beer and watching sports. <br>JESSE Yeah, that's true, but have you ever done that? I did it once with a friend of mine. Drank some beer, had some chips, and watched a couple of games. It was the first time in years I literally jumped for joy. On some level it's sticking your head in the sand, but on another I think it must serve some tribal purpose. <br>CELINE I actually agree with you. I kind of like sports. It's one of these few times when men are treated like stupid objects . . . I'm joking. So you haven't told me what you do. Are you still in school? <br>JESSE Nah, I never graduated from college. <br>CELINE Are you working? <br>JESSE I have a stupid job like everyone else. <br>CELINE Is it boring? You're not happy? <br>JESSE No, it's a decent job. I don't get paid that much. I don't do that much. <br>CELINE So what is the job? <br>JESSE I write for a newspaper, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, and pretty much get to do what I want there creatively, so it's okay. <br>CELINE So you write? <br>JESSE Kinda. <br>CELINE So has this trip been good for you? <br>JESSE Yeah. I mean, on one level, it sucked, but sitting on a train and staring out the window for days on end has actually been kind of great. <br>CELINE What do you mean? <br>JESSE I've had an idea I probably would never have had otherwise. Can I tell you about it? <br>CELINE Yes. <br>JESSE Some friends of mine are these cable access producers-you know, anyone can produce a program, and they have to show it. I got really jazzed about it. I imagined a show I want to produce that would last an entire year, twenty-four hours a day. I want to get 365 different video producers around the world to each make their own twenty-four-hour-long document of real time, capturing life around them just as it is lived. So it'd be people waking up, taking a long shower, getting a cup of coffee and reading the paper for twenty minutes, a long drive to work. <br>CELINE You mean all those boring, mundane things everyone has to do every day of their life? <br>JESSE I was going to say the poetry of day-to-day life. I mean, why is your dog so great just for sleeping in the sun? And a guy getting money out of a bank machine is a moron? <br>CELINE So you can put on the TV at any time of the day and see what other people are doing at the same time. <br>JESSE Right. It's like parallel lives. <br>CELINE That's great. I once lived in a big apartment I was sharing with friends, and we could see ten other apartments from the window. I would cut down the light, sit at the window, and watch them sitting on a couch doing nothing. It was fascinating. <br>JESSE That's the trick. Life is not really about drama. That we all do the same shit and going to some market in Arabia is the same as going to Kmart in Miami. People believe they are missing out, that everyone else has this great and exciting life and they don't. I mean, we all have to get dressed, feed the kids, get our driver's license renewed, look up what time the afternoon matinee starts, lose ourselves in entertainment, lose ourselves in sex, routine, getting a little too drunk, buying a present for someone you don't like very much-you feel guilty about not liking them, so you spend a little too much money. <br>CELINE So, it's like a National Geographic program on people? <br>JESSE Exactly. <br>CELINE I can see it: twenty-four boring hours and a three-minute sex scene where he falls asleep right after. <br>JESSE Exactly. And that would be an exciting episode. Maybe you and your friends can do one of those episodes from Paris. The key to making this work would be in the distribution. Getting the tapes from town to town on time . . . But it would play continuously twenty-four hours for a year on stations around the world. The waiter finally arrives and gives them the menus. <br><br>3 <br>INTERIOR: LOUNGE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON <br><i>Some time has passed. They have dirty dishes in front of them. They seem more relaxed with each other, more forthright, less self-conscious, a little more intimate. </i><br>CELINE My parents have never really spoken of the possibility of my falling in love or getting married or having children. Even as a little girl, they wanted me to think about a future career as a TV newscaster, or dentist, or something like that. <br>JESSE <i> (smiles) </i>Anchorwoman . . . <br>CELINE Yeah, I'd say to my dad I wanted to be a writer and he'd say journalist. I'd say I wanted to have a refuge for stray cats and he'd say veterinarian. I'd say I wanted to be an actress and he'd say TV newscaster. It was this constant conversion of my fanciful ambitions into practical moneymaking ventures. <br>JESSE Parents just want you to have a nice career so they can tell their friends something interesting. <i> (a beat) </i>I musta had a pretty decent bullshit detector when I was a kid. I always knew when they were lying to me. By the time I was in high school, I was dead set on listening to what everyone thought I should be doing with my life and then almost systematically doing the opposite. They weren't really mean about it. All their typical ambitions sounded so mediocre. <br>CELINE If you have parents that never fully contradict anything you want to do and are basically nice and supportive, it makes it harder to officially complain, even when they are wrong. It's this passive-aggressive shit. I can't stand it.</p><h2>Beyond the Light Barrier: The Autobiography of Elizabeth Klarer</h2><p>This is the autobiographical story of Elizabeth Klarer, a South African woman, and Akon, an astrophysicist from Meton, a planet of Proxima Centuri that, at a distance of about 4.3 light years, is our nearest stellar neighbor. Elizabeth was taken in his spaceship to Meton, where she lived with him and his family for four months and where she bore his child. Her life on Meton is fascinatingly described. Akon brought Elizabeth back to Earth after the birth of their son and continued to visit her thereafter.<p> Akon explained how his spaceship's light-propulsion technology operated, and how it allowed him and his people to travel across vast interstellar distances. This technology is explained in detail in the book.</p><p> Elizabeth was given a standing ovation at the 11th International Congress of UFO Research Groups at Weisbaden in 1975, and her speech as guest of honor was applauded by scientists of twenty-two nations.</p><p> Light Technology Publishing is proud to bring you the long-awaited American edition of Beyond the Light Barrier, which was first published in English in 1980.</p></p><p>Elizabeth Klarer (1910-1994) was born in Mooi River, Natal, South Africa.

She died in 1994 in South Africa.A profound, provocative book for the 21st century, --JJ Hurtak, PhD, Investigative researcher and founder of The Academy for Future Science, a United Nations NGO.</p><h2>The Art of Pastoring: Ministry Without All the Answers</h2><p><ul><li>Named one of the Top Ten Books of 1994 by the Academy of Parish Clergy</li></ul> Hundreds of books, tapes, workshops and seminars promise to answer these impossible questions. Some offer a set of practical guidelines; others suggest a system or pattern to follow. Some stress various ministry functions; others feature case studies as models of success or failure. Some are helpful. Others are not. But in <em>The Art of Pastoring,</em> David Hansen turns pastoral self-help programs on their heads. He tackles the perennial questions from within his own experience. <strong>From the Inside Out</strong> Hansen's fresh, bold narrative grows from nearly a decade of ministry. He draws you into his life and into the lives of Florence-Victor Parish in the mountains of Montana, including unforgettable encounters with unforgettable people--a stubborn pioneer woman who still chops her own firewood though she's blind and 90 years old, a championship rodeo cowboy who was baptized in his boots, and many more. Hansen's goal is to help you discover "that pastoral ministry is a life, not a technology . . . [that] life as a pastor is far more than the sum of the tasks I carry out. It is a call from God that involves my whole life." <strong>From Calling to Living Parable</strong> Every pastor has encountered those who struggle to hear God's voice in a hospital room, who reach for Jesus in the sacraments. No systematic answers can meet their deep, eternal needs. What can touch them, Hansen contends, is a life itself, a life lived as a parable of Jesus. "As a parable of Jesus Christ," Hansen writes, "I deliver something to the parishioner that I am not, and in the process I deliver the parishioner into the hands of God." It is this knack for getting to the heart of things that makes <em>The Art of Pastoring</em> valuable for pastors in any setting--rural, suburban or urban. Parachurch workers, missionaries, church leaders and ministry volunteers will also find inspiration here. In this significantly revised new edition, Hansen includes new insights into his view of pastorate as parable and adds a new postlude in which he comes clean on his "constant attempts to leave the ministry."</p><p><strong>David Hansen</strong> is pastor of Heritage Community Church in Cincinnati, Ohio. He has also pastored in Montana, the setting for many of the stories in this book. He has been a contributing editor for <em>Leadership Journal,</em> and is a frequent speaker at pastoral conferences."This book literally saved my ministry. " (From the foreword by Ian Stackhouse, Guildford Baptist Church, Surrey, UK)<br><br>"Hansen's <em>The Art of Pastoring</em> is a gem that most pastors should read every few years to recenter their lives and ministries on and in Jesus Christ. I do not fly fish, nor do I tend sheep. Yet I understand what Jesus means when he says to 'tend my sheep;' I also understand what Hansen means when he says that the pastor is the fisherman's fly." (Scott W. Sunquist, dean, School of Intercultural Studies, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"One of the most vexing questions students and graduates face centers on pastoral identity. Complicating this, most parishioners have no idea what are realistic expectations. David Hansen's <em>The Art of Pastoring</em> gives concise, centering answers. It is a pastoral theology drawn from years of pastoral experience, and it brings back into focus what a pastor is truly called to be and do. It is a much-needed corrective in a day pastors have succumbed to being therapists, CEOs or artists. It belongs in the curriculum of any school serious about training pastors."

As a core craft technology, pottery has underpinned domesticity, business, religion, recreation, architecture, and art for millenia. Indeed, the history of ceramics parallels the development of human society. Greenhalgh addresses the story of the pots themselves, the culture of the ceramics, and their character and meaning. Ceramics have had a presence in virtually every country and historical period, and have worked as a commodity servicing every social class. They are omnipresent: a ubiquitous art. Ceramic culture is a clear, unique, definable thing, and has an intenal logic that holds it together through millennia. Hence ceramics is the most peculiar and extraordinary of all the arts. At once cheap, expensive, elite, plebian, high-tech, low-tech, exotic, eccentric, comic, tragic, spiritual, and secular, it has revealed itself to be as fluid as the mud it is made from. Ceramics are the very stuff of how civilized life was, and is, led. They are one of human society&#39;s most surprising core causes and effects.</p><p>Paul Greenhalgh is Director of the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, UK.</p><h2>Sunset Lullaby, Christy &amp; Todd The Baby Years Book 3 (Volume 3)</h2><p><i><b>Sunset Lullaby</b></i> is Book #3 in the Christy &amp; Todd:The Baby Years Series. &nbsp;These the much loved characters from the modern classic Christy Miller Series have come alive to millions of readers over the last two decades.&nbsp; Girls who grew up with Christy and followed her through Christy &amp; Todd: The College Years are now flocking to Christy &amp; Todd: The Married Years and continuing to read Christy &amp; Todd:The Baby Years<br><br> In <i><b>Sunset Lullaby</b></i>&nbsp;avid fans will share the joys and pains along with Christy as she and Todd see their family grow and their lives continue to change.&nbsp; The characters model a realistic young marriage while showing readers how to honor God and grow closer as a couple during this very full season of life.</p><p>ROBIN JONES GUNN is the best-selling author of 100 books, including the widely popular Christy Miller series, Sierra Jensen series and Christy award-winning Christian fiction in the Glenbrooke and Sisterchicks series.

I am painfully conscious of my need for further grace.<br>&#x2014;A. W. Tozer, The Pursuit of God<br><br>It happened again.<br><br>I was not surprised.<br><br>Her words of frustration and longing spilled from her heart to my e-mail inbox.<br><br><i>Dear Sharon:<br>I have lived a very blessed life. I have been married to the same man for forty years. I have four beautiful daughters, who seem to have married the perfect mates, and nine wonderful grandchildren. I was raised in a Christian home, and my mother is still alive and healthy at eighty-five years old. My husband is retired, and we are living comfortably. I have never been abused or mistreated. I have friends, and most would say that I am a happy person. And yet, something is missing. With all the good things in my life, all I really want is a close relationship with Jesus.<br><br>I am trying, I really am. Even though I was raised in church, I married a Jewish man and drifted away from God. I gave my life to Christ at a women&#x2019;s Christian meeting fifteen years ago and have been pursuing God ever since. I felt that recommitment was necessary for me. It was a new beginning. Now I do an online Bible study, am an active member of a local church, visit a shut-in once a month, and help with vacation Bible school. I have taught Sunday school, and I attend church regularly and pray daily.<br><br>I have been reading and studying the Bible and know that when you seek forgiveness, it is given. I have asked God to forgive me of the choices I have made and believe that He has. Now I am asking God to let me know what His purpose is for my life. What does He want from me? What does He have planned for me? I am trying very hard to listen for His direction. I am willing to follow His path, whenever I realize what that is.<br><br>Here&#x2019;s the crux of my problem. After I gave my life to Christ, I joined a church and began reading the Bible daily. Yet I never experienced that overwhelming feeling of change that so many others experience. In my quiet times, when I seek to know Him better and wait quietly for answers, I do not get the nudges that others talk about. I know that some people hit rock bottom and then experience a dramatic life change accompanied by an emotional high. I sometimes wonder if I will have to experience some great trial in order to have the wonderful feelings of a true relationship with Christ. I have worked on identifying my sins, thinking that this might help me feel closer to God. I am working on not gossiping and not being prideful or vain. I am always working on my patience. I don&#x2019;t have any serious vices, but I am constantly working on self-improvement. I try to start each day with quiet time, Scripture reading, and prayer. I try to have a God-focused day.<br><br>Is something wrong with me? Do other women feel this emptiness too? Should I be feeling something more? What more should<br>I be doing? I know Christ loves me, but something is missing and&nbsp;I don&#x2019;t even know what it is. What should I do?<br>&#x2014;Stephanie<br></i><br>Oh, Stephanie, I whispered, no you are not alone. Your words echo the longings of women all around the world, and I dare say, through the ages. Why is feeling close to God so hard? Why does this faith journey seem so difficult?<br><br>There Must Be Something More<br><br>This was the first time I had heard from Stephanie but not the first time I had heard the heart-cry. The particulars of her story were different, but I had heard the same longing from countless others.<br><br>Most of us come to Christ with a certain &#x201c;inloveness&#x201d;&#x2014;a stirring of emotion mixed with an inexplicable knowing that we&#x2019;ve discovered our reason for being. But some years into our spiritual journey, the wonder that swelled during the early years ebbs into routine religion laced with busyness. And we secretly question the point of it all. There has to be more than this, we muse. There has to be something more. What am I missing? What&#x2019;s wrong with me? I&#x2019;m doing all<br>the right things, but God seems so far away. I&#x2019;m trying as hard as I can, but it never seems to be enough. What does God really want from me anyway?<br><br>For decades, as I have had the privilege of ministering to women, I have heard the same heart-cry from those who desire to have a deep, intimate, exuberant relationship with Christ but don&#x2019;t know how to find it.<br><br>Perhaps you can relate. You long to feel close to God but sense there&#x2019;s just something lacking, that you&#x2019;ve missed the mysterious formula to make it happen. I call this a &#x201c;glory ache&#x201d;&#x2014;a persistent longing to experience God&#x2019;s presence on<br>a daily basis. Perhaps like most women, you&#x2019;ve tried desperately to balance the montage of mundane demands and somehow slip God into the white spaces that are few and far between. You long to spend time in the sacred with God<br>but find the desire crowded out by the responsibilities of the secular&#x2014;the daily demands that lay claim to your attention. You yearn to experience God&#x2019;s presence but feel far away from Him as you reach to click off the bedside lamp and collapse exhausted once again. Maybe tomorrow, you sigh.<br><br>Sound familiar? If so, you are not alone.<br><br>The travesty is that we allow the busyness of life to crowd out the Source of life. As the psalmist wrote, &#x201c;We are merely moving shadows, and all our busy rushing ends in nothing&#x201d; (Psalm 39:6, nlt). Ann Voskamp echoes that lament: &#x201c;In a world addicted to speed, I blur the moments into one unholy smear.&#x201d;1<br><br>And in that unholy smear, that blur of the world passing quickly by, we know something&#x2019;s not quite right. So we strike out to make it all better. And most of us are quick to think &#x201c;something more&#x201d; means &#x201c;doing more.&#x201d; We ramp it up and gun the engines&#x2014;sign up for a new committee, volunteer for a new cause, bake one more casserole to feed the sick. We attempt to silence the hunger pains of the heart by feeding it the bread and water of duty. And at the end of the day, while we might feel a self-induced sense of well-being, the hollowness in our souls that can only be satisfied with God echoes with the grumblings of hunger still.<br><br>We long for a sense of closeness with God, but we have a hard time putting our finger on exactly what that closeness would look like. It&#x2019;s just something more. Something different. A flavor we have yet to taste. A country we have yet to visit. A sunset we have yet to experience. A lover we have yet to embrace. There has to be something more, we cry! And we are quite right. We are craving the closeness that comes with an intimate relationship with Jesus.<br><br>So we try harder. We go to Bible studies, attend church, say our prayers, and read our devotions. Check, check, check. And yet, we constantly feel that we are somehow letting God down. With the last &#x201c;amen&#x201d; of the day, we sigh, What more does God want from me?<br><br>One January morning a few years ago, I asked God that same question. I had just finished a big writing project and was ready to tackle the next big thing for God. I snuggled in my favorite den chair with a steamy cup of coffee and my well-worn Bible to spend some alone time with my heavenly Father. I read a few verses and said my prayer. Check. Check. When I started to get up, I felt God&#x2019;s invisible strong hand holding me back. He wasn&#x2019;t finished. Be still, and<br>know that I am God, He seemed to say. Cease striving.<br><br>Suddenly I saw myself with the disciples caught on the stormy Sea of Galilee. As I pondered the past twenty-five years of my life, I saw myself reeling in the waves of ceaseless activity. A squall of busyness raging around me&#x2014;and in me. Reeling from one foamy crest of work and deadlines to the next and hanging on for dear life. In my mind&#x2019;s eye, the fellow passengers were not the motley crew of first-century disciples but women from every walk, trying to steady themselves in the turbulent waters of life.<br><br>&#x201c;Teacher, don&#x2019;t you care if we drown?&#x201d; they asked. &#x201c;Help us!&#x201d;<br><br>Then I sensed Jesus speaking to me just as He had spoken to the raucous wind and waves: &#x201c;Quiet! Be still! Settle down!&#x201d;<br><br>So I sat.<br><br>After a few moments, I realized I didn&#x2019;t really know how to be quiet and settle down. I had never mastered the full idea of &#x201c;be still and know.&#x201d; I knew that God was God. It was the &#x201c;be still&#x201d; part that stumped me. Sitting still was not in my nature, and perhaps it was my nature that God was trying to tame. My &#x201c;nature,&#x201d; or natural bent of working for God, was standing in the way of my worship of and communion with God. My daily routine of sanctioned quiet times was getting in the way of the divine romance in which He wanted me to engage.</p><h2>Wicked Sexy Liar (Wild Seasons)</h2><p>When three college besties meet three hot guys in Vegas, anything can&#x2014;and does&#x2014;happen.

Everything&#x2019;s going great and according to the non-plan.<br> <br> But when a wave knocks her for a loop one morning, then Luke Sutter&#x2019;s flirtatious smile knocks her for another that evening, she veers slightly off course...and into his path. Sure, he&#x2019;s a total player, but the <i>Why not&#x2014;it&#x2019;s only one night</i> is a persistent voice in her ear.<br> <br> For his part, Luke&#x2019;s been on hookup autopilot for so long that he rarely ever pauses to consider what he&#x2019;s doing. But after an amazing time with London, he realizes that he hasn&#x2019;t been moving on from a devastating heartbreak so much as he&#x2019;s been drifting to wherever&#x2014;and <i>whom</i>ever&#x2014;the current takes him. With London he wants <i>more</i>.<br> <br> Every relationship involves two people...plus their pasts.

The problems they face as a couple &#x2014; Luke trying to leave behind his caddish ways and London fighting an ingrained sense of caution and reserve &#x2014; are achingly real.

In this groundbreaking new book, David Wood examines the far more pervasive yet less understood experience of those we send to war: moral injury, the violation of our fundamental values of right and wrong that so often occurs in the impossible moral dilemmas of modern conflict. Featuring portraits of combat veterans and leading mental health researchers, along with Wood's personal observations of war and the young Americans deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, <i>What Have We Done</i> offers an unflinching look at war and those who volunteer for it: the thrill and pride of service and, too often, the scars of moral injury.<br><br>Impeccably researched and deeply personal, <i>What Have We Done</i> is a compassionate, finely drawn study of modern war and those caught up in it. It is a call to acknowledge our newest generation of veterans by listening intently to them and absorbing their stories; and, as new wars approach, to ponder the inevitable human costs of putting American "boots on the ground."</p><p>David Wood, a veteran war reporter, is a staff correspondent for the <i>Huffington Post</i>, where he won the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for national reporting on severely wounded warriors. A birthright Quaker and raised as a pacifist, Wood has spent more than thirty years covering the U.S. military and conflicts around the world, most recently in extended deployments embedded with American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan."With <i>What Have We Done</i> David Wood has written what may be one of the best, most riveting and accessible presentations on moral injury and how it differs from Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)....David Wood is a major voice moving moral, ethical and spiritual dimensions front and center in understanding and helping our warriors."&#x2015;<b><i>Edward Tick, PhD, author of <i>War and the Soul</i> and Warrior's Return, co-founder and director of Soldier's Heart, Inc.</i></b><br><br>"David Wood makes other reporters smack their foreheads and ask themselves why they didn't do that story. It was sitting right there in front of you and you didn't see it until David put it all together."&#x2015;<b><i>David Martin, national security correspondent, CBS News</i></b><br><br>"<i>What Have We Done</i> is a landmark effort. Extraordinary work, and exceptional treatment of a strange, damaging phenomenon. We cannot begin to solve the problem until it's properly identified. Perhaps now we can begin to heal. Bravo!"<br>&#x2015;<b><i>LTC Kevin Petit, U.S. Army (ret), veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan</i></b><br><br>"David Wood is a treasure--a defense reporter who is both knowledgeable and morally perceptive. Plus, he can write. Read this and you will learn about our soldiers, our wars, and even the times in which we live. If I could, every time I heard someone thank someone else 'for their service,' I'd give both parties a copy of this book."<br>&#x2015;<b><i>Thomas E. Ricks, author of Fiasco and The Generals</i></b><br><br>"The most critical part in warrior development is what we call the moral component--the set of beliefs that allows the soldier to trust his chain of command and his mate, and to do what warriors must do. We do that brilliantly in America, up to the point the trigger is pulled. What David Wood has produced here in a gripping, superb storytelling manner, is the analysis of the aftermath of the trigger pull, and how we must improve how we as a society help the warrior return to peace."&#x2015;<b><i>Paul D. Eaton, Major General, US Army (retired)</i></b><br><br>"Wood has brilliantly articulated the harsh and lasting realities of the moral injury from Iraq and Afghanistan for so many who fought and served honorably. He uses his own, vivid memories of war, and the haunting memories of those who fought our wars to 'pressurize the soul' of America, urging all of us to deal with this almost universally ignored injury of the heart and soul. Heartbreaking and compelling!"<br>&#x2015;<b><i>Admiral Mike Mullen, 17th Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2007-2011</i></b><br><br>"David Wood is the best of the best. He gets out in the dust and mud and danger with the troops, and they revere him--which I know from them directly. Tissues at the ready! You will weep."<br>&#x2015;<b><i>Jonathan Shay, MD, PhD, author of <i>Achilles in Vietnam</i> and <i>Odysseus in America </i></i></b><br><br>"This is a rare achievement.

Litz, PhD, clinical psychologist, VA Boston Healthcare System and Boston University Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences</i></b><br><br>"It's not often that a war correspondent reveals the darker consequences of military service...

Roemer [is] America's most decorated FBI agent."<br>--Chicago Tribune<br>For forty years Tony Accardo was America's most dangerous criminal. He cut his teeth on the Chicago mob wars of Capone and Elliot Ness. He got his nickname "Joe Batters" for killing two men with a baseball bat. As the bodies piled up, Capone's youngest capo murdered and schemed his way to the top.<br>William Roemer was the first FBI agent to face Tony "The Big Tuna" Accardo. Now, Roemer tells the story that only he could tell: the deals, the hits, the double-crosses, and the power plays that reached from the Windy City to Hollywood and to New York. Drawing on secret wiretaps and inside information, ACCARDO chronicles bloodshed and mayhem for more than six decades--as Roemer duels against the most powerful don of them all. . . .<br>"Roemer brings the reality of organized crime home to us."<br>--Boston Herald<br>"A big, sprawled out account that serves as anecdotal history of organized crime."<br>--Kirkus Reviews</p><p><b>William F. Roemer, Jr. </b>(1926&#x2013;1996) was a retired FBI agent well known for his role in infiltrating the Mafia. He wrote several books on his experience as an FBI agent, including <i>Accardo: The Genuine Godfather </i>and <i>The Enforcer: Spilotro&#x2014;The Chicago Mob&#x2019;s Man Over Las Vegas</i>.Nicknamed "Joe Batters" by Al Capone because he beat two thugs to death with a baseball bat, Tony Accardo (1906-1992) would go on to impress his mob superiors by using "Chicago Choppers"?Thompson submachine guns?at the infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre in 1929. After the demise of Capone, Accardo quickly moved to the forefront of the mob hierarchy, becoming a capo under Capone's successor, Frank Nitti, and concentrating on gambling operations. Roemer, who exhibits a grudging respect for Accardo, alleges without documentation that the mob under Accardo bought off U.S. Attorney General Tom Clark with an appointment to the Supreme Court. Also covered are Accardo's appearance before the Kefauver Committee in 1951, where he was cited for contempt of Congress; his Chicago mob's late move into Las Vegas; his "retirement" to consiglieri in 1957; how J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI were finally forced to join the battle against organized crime after the infamous Apalachin, N.Y., mob meeting in 1957; Accardo's prohibition on selling narcotics; and his ordered "hit" on Sam Giancana. Roemer (The Enforcer), former senior agent on the organized crime squads of the Chicago FBI, has written a colorful biography rich in fact, anecdote and speculation. Photos.
